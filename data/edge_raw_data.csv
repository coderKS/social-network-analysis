78,18,20170310,5,"This post is great. There are a lot of concepts and ideas that invoke my thinking. Nowadays, people are perceiving the information every day, however, no one knows the actual process of the perception. Sometimes, we are blind because of the horizon like a frog in the well. Sometimes, we would like to dive into a virtual game or movie to experience an entirely different world. And I do believe that learning the concept of HII will help us know much more about ourselves. Thanks for the post."
2,18,20170310,5,"A very profound post. I cannot agree more with the concept that our cognition process is more or less influenced by the ambient. That??s also why people usually behaves uncertainly comparing with the machine. Being aware of the cognition influence factor, people are intended to design the environmental objects to stimulate the cognition process. That is absolutely great discovery and will be beneficial for people in a long time."
58,18,20170310,5,"Thanks for your post. I find interesting in the discussion about the communication system. It is quite inspiring that we as the student from Information engineering major are trying to making the information flows efficiently and elegantly. All courses that we learned is trying to help people touch the information and interact with it. At end of the day, we should also be aware of the way people perceive and interact with the information and that is probably why we are studying this topic."
60,18,20170310,5,"Now we can no long bear with the world without the social network. With the help of the social network, we can get touch with others more easily and it definitely increases the connection between each other. And I highly agree with your idea that we now live in a world base on internet and mobile technology."
78,18,20170310,5,"This is an absolutely brilliant post. I get a deeper understanding of the information technology in different ways. The idea that information technology is actually helping us have a further recognition of the world is very inspiring. There are a lot of problems and puzzles that are hardly solved by human brain now is just a simple problem for the computers. With help of algorithms, I believe we are approaching closer to the real nature of the world. The technology is empowering people with a stronger and more powerful cognitive tool, which is definitely a benefit for humankind in large view."
60,18,20170310,5,"Thanks for connecting the information entropy concept with the communication principle course. I think entropy is originally generated from the physics area. Then we can also describe the degree of the chaos for information by information entropy. If I understand it in a correct way, the physical world is increasing its entropy no matter what happened, meanwhile, the information must obey the same rule. And we can have a better description of the information that it is keeping enlarging and will be always increasing, which is fascinating and a little bit threatening. Nevertheless, we can better master the essence of the world, isn't it great?"
2,18,20170310,5,"I am interested in Amazon Go as much as you are and it's my pleasure to share opinions with you. 1. In response to @cheunglokin, I think what you are afraid of is absolutely reasonable. More and more data is collected and the cyber security is definitely the top concern of all the users. However, the positive side of the data collection is that Amazon can acquire more data about the customers and personalise their service. On the other hand, in the future, even the supermarket will be smarter and more considerate to each customer. isn't it a great thing? 2. In the economical view, the machine can never replace anyone in the world. In the past days, people needs a driver to drive a carriage. With the development of technology, everyone can drive a vehicle. Those who are used to work as carriage drivers are now freed from the boring job and are entitled to more creative jobs. Overall, it will be a great thing that the machine can replace more and more people in the world. It is the signal that more and more people can work for the much higher level of the work and consequently people's lives will be much better. I do believe technology will empower human with the stronger ability and better life quality."
58,18,20170311,5,"I learned a lot of the contextual computing and its application from your post. Thanks for the elaboration and explanation. It seems that no matter in the digital world or the physical world the contextual information is always very useful for helping people make decisions. In the era of big data, more and more company are exerting every opportunity on collecting user data and trying to provide the smart choice by contextual computing. It really helps me to understand the importance of the big data technology, although your focus might be the contextual computing. Thanks for this inspiring post."
58,18,20170311,5,"Your introduction to the sentimental analysis is very clear and easy to understand. I got a full picture of the sentiment analysis with two aspects in content analysis and NLP. In my opinion, the general method of the opinion mining is to exert the machine to imitate the understanding process of the human brain. As the trending technology of Convolutional Neural Network, it is to some way to stimulate the neural cells of people's brain. To some degree, I believe that our computers will become something similar to ourselves humankind. And the ability to understand the sentiment and context of the machine will be as strong as human beings."
78,18,20170311,5,"I think to some degree you misuse the idea of NLP and compilation. What I believe is that NLP is talking about people are trying to utilise the machine to understand the massive natural language that is used every day. However, in terms of the compilation that the program is translated into machine code, it is much easier than NLP because we can define the syntax and the meaning of the programming language. If you would like to take a look at my post, I am writing a general comparison between NLP and compilation. Hopefully, my post can help you understand the difference between these two concepts."
2,18,20170312,5,"That is a very comprehensive description of the data in social networks. I am really appreciated that you mentioned a lot of concepts like data category, data quality and characteristics of social data. I highly agree with you that there are plenty of rubbish posts that are useless for analysing. And consequently, we might need computers to help us clean the data and filtrate the valuable data. However, when we trying to work with data, we actually have no clue about the destination that we are approaching. It suggests that sometimes the so-call rubbish data may have valuable usage for other purposes. What we have to do is to find the most appropriate threshold in filtering data and do not set any potential conclusion before the work is done."
60,18,20170312,5,"I am really appreciated that you shared your detailed thinking and discovery about the sentiment analysis. I find it's interesting that there is some company deploying human-based sentimental analysis or hybrid method. I think in terms of the social network where millions of posts generated every day, it is impossible to barely employ staff working on sentiment analysis. And we can depend on machine learning techniques in dealing with this problem because the results are not that critical. It is also acceptable that some mistakes are made. And I personally believe that in the future the machine learning approach will be more accurate and there will be no need to utilise the manpower to work on sentiment analysis."
20,14,20170313,5,"Affordance is one of the important concept when building User Interface. Using icons with clear meaning can provide more accurate and user-friendly guidelines. there are lots of online resources of using icons. one of the online resources I use frequently is Font Awesome, just including the url as a single line inside the section while building website."
48,14,20170313,5,"Some people especially the older generation may have negative concerns on whether Artificial intelligence is safe or not. what is your opinion, Kelwin? In my opinion, some Artificial intelligence such as Autonomous car can greatly reduce the number of car accident, but in a pessimistic view, lots of jobs may be replaced by those Artificial intelligence, lots of people may lose their jobs. By the way, variety of machine learning techniques by accessing large amount of data (big data) nowadays brings us solutions for more and more complex problems, just make us more abd more convenient than before."
20,14,20170313,5,"Assume the user interface is just like YAHOO NEWS, users need to click the title of article to read the whole article. while clicking the title of article for reading, the number of times of reading articles with specific category by a user can be known and will be stored in the sql database. As one single article or advertisements have several categories, we can use the recommendation system to recommend articles and advertisements to user. Using rating system, it is more accurate for us to know the preference of user for reading articles. Just rejecting the article or advertisements with low rating, thr recommendation system can recommend the most suitable article or advertisements for the users."
48,14,20170314,5,"I agree that there are lots of security issues in social media. For example, lots of people may enjoy in doing Facebook quizzes, but all the personal information and answers in the quizzes maybe sold to commercial company, even use it for cracking passwords and meeting friends around the user. Some fake virus alert in Facebook may also trick the people to click the link that supposed to fix the virus, but actually it contains malware that may inflect the user??s computer. The use of applications in Facebook also put the user??s information at risk, even only the friends of the user use these applications. Be aware of these security issues in Facebook!"
39,51,20170311,5,"I think UX is more than just how user-friendly a software or an application is. It is also about the layout, whether it is dull or artistic. This might not be what our engineering learning focuses on but as a user I would prefer a colourful and attractive apps more than a dull and boring one."
45,51,20170311,5,"Your post reminds me of IERG3830 Product Design Project. This year??s project focus is mainly on Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality and my group is currently working on a project which combines AR with Piano. Surely there could be a lot of possibilities for us to explore in the scope of both AR and VR but while we are researching on this topic, we found that the equipment supporting these technologies are extremely expensive. Hopefully in a not too distant future there would be alternatives that are affordable for the public. After all, technology should be advanced yet available for everyone."
10,51,20170311,5,"I do agree with online stores being convenient and require less capital for retailers but I think that traditional in-store environment still have its competitiveness. Personally I like trying on clothings and shoes before buying them, especially after a few terrible experiences with Taobao haha~"
41,69,20170313,5,"I also agree with you and I like your interesting examples :) As you have mentioned, I think Chinese is one of special language. Different combination with other words will result to a totally different meaning. Same words can be interpreted in a very different way by other people. A different manner of speaking and speaking tone will also affect the meaning of the sentence. Moreover, I believe that robot will not rule human or the world but work with us because they depend on us. Also if robots did get out of hand, we would be able to stop it before it is too late."
19,69,20170313,5,"In my opinion, to decide whether Naive Bayes classifier is good or not depends on you are in which circumstance. We can??t expect it to be perfect for all language model.There are a number of dimensions we should look at to decide what will be a reasonable algorithm we should apply, such as: How large is the training set? Are features independent? What are the system's requirement in terms of speed/performance/memory usage...? Therefore, if we want to do something super simple, fast, and effective like semi-supervised learning, Naive Bayes classifier is what are we looking for."
25,69,20170313,5,"Apart form education industry which already has quite well development, I think fashion industry, airline companies filmmaking and storytelling etc are potential users to adopt VR. Furthermore, I believe VR could one day incorporate all the senses to provide user immersive experience. Existing VR only simulate things you can see and hear. The most possible development in the future will be the sense of touch which people can touch virtual environments just like in reality."
13,69,20170314,5,"I also have the same experience when online shopping :) With sentiment analysis, it can filter out the most relevant and helpful comment and we can save a lot of time to scan all comments one by one. Actually, it do increase the desire of shopping because it improve the user experience! A good UX design do help user gain information with minimum concentration and give user a great satisfaction. Furthermore, I think there is still a long way to analyse the words or sentence structures to explore the internal world of human beings because it is difficult for the computer to understand the complicated emotion of human, especially using Chinese language which even same words can be interpreted in a very different way by different people or in different situations."
32,27,20170313,5,"I think your point ""Songs and music are the ""apps"" of earlier era"" is interesting. I totally agree with you after thinking again your point. In the past, people use songs and music for communication not only inside the country, but also across the country. Some famous songs attracted other country people and translated in their own language and spread in their country. For example, the song of Air Supply ""All Out of Love"" was covered by Hong Kong singer Mr Tam and become another well-known song ""???L??"". Music is amazing. I think music can benefit from the growth of Internet era since there are better platform for the music producer to share to. More people can exchange their ""information"". Isn't it?"
52,27,20170314,5,"Yes, I totally agree with your point of "" Machine Learning is Interesting "". If you really interested in machine learning, I highly recommend you to try Watson which I have learnt in SEEM4680 in last semester. Watson is a famous machine learning program of IBM. It has a function basically for conversation use. And the most attractive thing is easy to handle. You can train the program as what you want to provide. At the last semester ,I have created the Intent and Entity, using ""if-then-else"" case the to create the dialog flow and the response, then the program will learn the whole flow and perform it. For me, I have designed ""CUHK Canteen Adviser"" and it is successful! Therefore, feel free to have a try on Watson for learning more about Machine Learning."
33,27,20170314,5,"I agree with your point of ""helping the disability to explore the world "" and make us entertain more at home. As the VR technology is developing, people can now travel the world or playing a horror game (Biohazd in PS4) via VR. VR definitely provide lots of amazing and exciting "" real experience"". However, I think VR can only PARTLY giving the ""physical information"" to us since nowadays VR only provide sound and scene (some may contains vibration). As a real ""physical information"", touching and smelling are also important elements for creating our memory. Therefore, we still can not make this become ""Real"" memory. Yet, the technology is keep on evolving. And nowadays there are some 4D movies included the touching and the smelling sense. By combining two technologies together, creating ""REAL physical information (memory)"" by VR will become POSSIBLE."
37,40,20170310,5,It is true that people are more likely to spend their time on social media through Internet. Therefore it is one of the good ways to promote the society through social media to let more people know about. I hope Mahjong society will become a registered society under Student Union soon.
67,64,20170308,5,"Maybe the alien and the human can communicate with symbols or actions. When they do not have a common language, it is much easier for them to communicate with image or actions. Maybe those tools can help them to solve the misunderstanding problem. haha."
6,22,20170309,5,I agree with you. Rumours are having an increasing influence in our society. We have to receive our information from credible news sources and prevent spreading unverified information on social media.
64,22,20170309,5,"I agree with you that using sentiment analysis is vital for businesses to understand their customers' opinions. By understanding the opinions, companies can have a more efficient and personal communications with their customers in order to maintain a dynamic customer relationship."
6,22,20170309,5,"I agree with you that people do use language creatively. Informal usage language, misspell and oversimplified sentences may cause extra difficulties in understanding the meaning of natural language using computer program."
53,22,20170309,5,I agree with you that HII plays an important role in our society. People shared their thoughts and opinions on social media platform. We could obtain the information that would be useful for different industries.
64,22,20170310,5,"I do agree with you that machine learning is a more reductive approach to avoid storing huge volume of information in database. In fact, a company in Japan released a product which using the principle of machine learning for flipping burgers."
64,22,20170310,5,I think you are right. Our conception are influenced by others opinion. And that is the very fundamental reason why we need to analyze people's online opinions.
35,22,20170310,5,"I agree with you. Speaking of the complexity of cognition process, the idea of social cognition further complicate our understanding of HII. We have no longer deemed human perception is an indivadual process but rather a social process involving human interactions within the community."
58,3,20170308,5,"Thank you for your sharing on contextual computing. You said that we are now expecting the smart devices can make a prediction before we make a decision. However, I think it may cause an information flood problem. I afraid that they may send some irrelevant information to the user. Worse still, the personal data of users may be recorded. How they can keep the data in private. I think this will be a big challenge for the developer."
62,3,20170308,5,"Your blog which about the Facebook news feed algorithm is really interesting. Therefore, I also search for it and find a simplified equation on how does Facebook choose what to show in news feed. Here is the equation, news feed visibility = C * P * T * R. C is representing the creator, how interested are we to the post's creator. P means the performance of the post.T means type of post. Are we interested in photo, video or link? R means recency, how new is the post. If we stick to this equation, our post may be read by more people."
25,3,20170308,5,"In your blog, you have mentioned several benefits of the VR technology. However, there are also some drawbacks of using VR. For the technology part, the technology required for a natural experience is still elusive. It is difficult for the haptic systems to provide physical feedback within a clumsy environment. For the Social part, it may lead to social isolation. Since the users over-relying on the interactions that take place in the virtual world, they may try to get rid of the social interaction in the real world. This kind of isolation may finally lead to depression or disassociation."
7,3,20170309,5,"I agreed that AR is a powerful tool, not only helping people to gain information between the virtual world and reality, but also bring more profits to the companies. Companies can use AR to let the customers have a closer look at the product, so as to enhance their shopping experience. Take an example of a furniture company, they can allow their potential customers to display virtual images of furniture to see whether it fit their living room or not. So that the customers can make a better choice and also increase the company's revenue."
71,3,20170309,5,"Your blog has reminded me a British science fiction television anthology series, ??Black Mirror"". In one of the episode named ??Be Right Back"", it talked about a women who lost her husband in a car accident and she found a technology that allow her to communicate with an artificial intelligence imitating husband. This technology worked because it collected all the past online data of her husband. I think this kind of technology may really work in the future. Just like what you have said, if the computer can get all four graphs of information of me, it can fully predict what is going on with me or even pretend it is me. Last but not least, I would like to recommend you to watch this science fiction ??Black Mirror"", it talks about the drawbacks of over-relying on the technology. Also it brings out some new ideas of technology that may really work in the future. Hope you enjoy it."
10,3,20170313,5,"Thank you for your sharing. After reading your blog, I have a clearer concept about how opinion mining work. In your blog, you have mentioned that if the companies make good use of opinion mining, they may promote their products more efficiently. I also found that we can make use of opinion mining in our college FYP. Since we have to conduct surveys to collect data from the interviewee, these data are random and difficult for us to analysis. If we adopt the opinion mining, we can easily classify whether the interviewee agrees with the question or not. This show a way that we can apply what we have learnt."
55,3,20170314,5,"Thank you for your sharing. I agreed that technology has made learning become more convenient. We don't have to go to the library to borrow the reference book, we can just search for it on the internet. It seems that the chances that we can learn new knowledge become more and more. However, the information on the internet may not be always true. Therefore, we have to distinguish which pieces of information are useful. If we have a wise use of the technology, they can definitely help us to learn faster and more."
25,3,20170314,5,"Your blog is very useful. After reading your blog, I know more about the differences between supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning. They are very useful for our daily life.Therefore, I searched on the internet and found the top 10 AI and machine learning use cases that everyone should know. One of them is the Natural Language Processing(NLP). Combining machine learning with the NLP, can help the customer service agents to route their customers to the information that they need. If you are also interested in the top 10 use cases, you may visit the website, https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/09/30/what-are-the-top-10-use-cases-for-machine-learning-and-ai/#4ae4910f94c9Thank you for your sharing."
41,3,20170314,5,"Thank you for your sharing. I agreed that it is difficult for the machine to translate the meaning of the words correctly. Take an example of google translation, it is always difficult if we try to use it to translate a paragraph in Chinese to English. It is because it didn't understand the meaning of the whole paragraph, but only translate it word by word. Language is a mysterious thing that we must read the words before and after that word in order to understand it. However, machines are lack of this kind of ability."
4,72,20170314,5,"I agree that Computer-Supported Cooperative Work contributes for engineering / CS student. You mentioned that CSCW provide as interdisciplinary platform. Actually, It can be performed by CSCW Matrix. We can work in interdisciplinary platform with same time or different time, same place or different place. We can separate it into four parts including Face to Face interactions, Continuous task, Remote interactions and communicates+ coordination. As a result, engineering / CS student can work in group efficiently with CSCW."
2,2,20170311,5,"Yes, security problem is what our customers may concern about. Authentication center is needed to make sure the database is a black box to the hacker. Maybe some mature security technology will be applied to the Amazon Go.:)"
2,2,20170311,5,"Thanks for your reply.One thing I think you need to consider about is that not all people can have a capacity to get a higher level job. I mean a people who has a low educational background can only do as a ??blue-collar??. If the government or society can not make an arrangement for them. They may can not ??survive?? in our society after the machine replace their work. Of course, it is another BIG and tricky question we need to consider."
59,15,20170320,6,"This passage gives us a brief introduction of human information interaction, which is probably one of the most important but also easy-to-ignore concept in our daily life.In my opinion, the author emphasized on the relationship between our major-IE and the concepts we learnt from class. It is indeed a very good try because the description may be useful in our future life. Also, the article have a deep insight in our future career, our advantages and disadvantages, which is also helpful for IE students. However, the passage seem to be lack of thorough analysis of the relationship between different concepts, which can be improved and elaborated a bit more."
59,15,20170320,6,"This passage analyzes the digital information in two aspects: one is the overview of basic concepts in digital information. The author gives a concise description of digital information, human agents and digital agents. The concepts are presented in a well-organized manner and impressed me a lot. Another one is about the tools of analyzing digital information, I learnt something from you and it??s helpful. However, if you can build a network of critical words in digital information, it maybe better for you to construct a well-structure article."
38,15,20170320,6,"This passage combines the basic knowledge taught in class and advanced staff taught in Elite class together, which gives us a whole picture of class material. Its is really help because it summarizes the overall structure of clustering methods. Also, the author illustrates the one application into her course project, which is impressive and offer some suggestions to the application usage. It would be better if the author can add some programming segments into the passage to make it more persuasive."
38,15,20170320,6,"This passage mainly reviewed the basic techniques of sentiment analysis taught in class, the author expressed the quintuple constitution using an example of a product, which is tailor-made and persuasive. However, I have to say that I hardly find some unique thoughts extended from the material taught in class. It seems better if you can put up with some personal insight or doubt."
38,15,20170320,6,"A really good case studying for our classmates. On the one hand, you introduced the working of Netflix recommendation system clearly to us, which helps us to understand the basic flow of training system. On the other hand, you also raise up some concerns about the underlying error, which is also very reasonable. However, there is one point I want to raise up: Can we continuously use the input data as the training model, so while we are testing the system, we are also training the system? It is just a guess."
38,15,20170320,6,"The blog basically describe the input-process-output(IPO) information processing model, the author raised up an interesting example for us to think about and finally explained her idea. What impressed me most is the point of fragmented memory. I mean, it's really surprising because it changed my previous perspective in which the memory is not flexible. However, I doubt whether it's true that the existing memory is correlated with perception, is there any proof from the neuro science perspective?"
60,15,20170320,6,"The blog post by you provided a deep and thorough analysis of information foraging theory, which is a part of knowledge I am not very clear in class. It is very useful for me! The basic idea is that the information foraging is an instinct of human being and human apply this theory into practical areas like web page ranking. It makes sense to me since I also try to use the least effort to get most information. A really well-explained article and I learnt a lot from it!"
60,15,20170320,6,"A really good reflection of concept entropy from you! You firstly gives some interpretation from different aspects generally, then deeply introduced the meaning of entropy, which was presented in a well-structured manner. I also love the example you provide since it makes the concept easy to understand. From the meta-cognition perspective, I really gained some knowledge of how to explain the concepts clearly and reader-friendly. However, I reckon that it would be even better if you can add in some real-life example using entropy analysis. Isn't it?"
34,15,20170320,6,"In your article, I can see you have introduced the different tradeoff between large-scale modelling and precise data analysis. As far as I am concerned, these are two different directions of researching approaches. One is up-down, the other is bottom-up. (Just like the project we are doing, right?) However, what I concern most is that what is the best way of combining them together? It seems that filling the gap is one of the most crucial part since there is no guarantee that your data will fit in your model. If you create a prior model that contains a bunch of essential aspects of sentiment analysis, the data you collected maybe too narrow and hard to classify. On the other way, if you first perform the data analysis, you may also encounter the non-typical user-generated information and even fail to construct a model. I am wondering whether we can discuss about this problem. By the way, it is also a major problem of our project. ."
34,15,20170320,6,"Thanks for you sharing! It seems that you did a thorough research of Amazon GO, a newly developed selling form nowadays. You firstly have a brief introduction of Amazon Go, which is clear and easy to follow. Then you show us the difference between contexts of Amazon Go and normal supermarkets. What impressed me most is that you combine the concepts introduced in the previous classes (agent's understanding of environment information classification) into the real-life cases, which deepen my perception of theorectical knowledge with practical examples. However, there is one point I cannot fully understand, why the information in Amazon Go is mainly digital? Since in my perspective, for instance, the sensor will detect the physical movement of objects, the camera will recognize the physical features of human face, people will read the price and goods information, these are all physical and semantic information. So my point maybe a bit different from you, I reckon that there is a complex combination of three types of information here, and the higher-layer information makes use of the lower-layer information. Do you agree?"
2,15,20170320,6,"Thanks for your precious sharing! The article brings about several interesting facts which is unseen to normal people. Firstly, there are several concepts like working memory which is often ignored by us. It seems we can only store a little bit information in a timestamp and we will use them to do the decision! I am impressed by this idea and it's also important to recognize human behavior. Also, the point of making use of this phenomenon to improve benefit is attracting. Overall, it's a good idea and I just wonder is there any scientific proof to make it more concrete?"
2,15,20170320,6,"Thanks for your sharing and I think I also gained a lot after reading the comments provided by previous students. As a summary, I basically think there are two general ways to do the natural language processing, one is the method we used in our project, which is dictionary-based approach. We first put in a bunch of training data like sentences or words, then we can use the dictionary to map the words into the correct meaning. However, it's not quite efficient and it cannot solve the problem you mentioned in the post. Another method maybe using the neural network, combining with the previous ides, I also have a suggestion: except from recursively selecting the optimal performance, can we also make use of the distributed system to make progress? I mean, if the a number of machines all over the world can contribute their resources together and build a overall language map, will it be better to establish a whole network? It's like the propagation algorithm, each node pass their message to their ancestors and do it again reversely. In this way, the complexity is also not too large. As far as I am concerned, it may serve as another direction of thinking."
18,15,20170320,6,"Thanks for your sharing! I find that you have basically introduced the development of the digital device nowadays and I learnt about the trend of technology is going towards interactive,portable and realistic. I consider the trend of human-machine development it's a process of information emerging. Human knows about sentiment and physical information, but machines can only understand the digital type of information. So it is an essential issue to make machine get a command of human-perceiveable information. No matter Siri, NLP or artificial intelligence, the main idea behind it is all the same. I agree with the point with you and the previous command, which is the humanlike developing trend. However, I also concern about how far can machine goes in this direction. Indeed, human nowadays have already achieved weak-AI, however, these are just basic intelligence level as a child. Is that possible to achieve strong AI or even more brilliant than human being? I reckon it's a question that worth discussing."
59,38,20170321,6,"Thanks for helping us review the three modes of information- physical, semantic anddigital; moreover, these three elements can be combined in some cases. You mentioned thatyou are confused about the perception layer on physical mode; and there is no detailedexplanation about this concept in the reference book.I want to share my understanding of this concept with you, please allow me to explain indetail.Obviously, the perception layer(i.e. perception/ cognation) in this graph bridges physicalmode and semantic mode, which means that we need perception/ cognation to transferphysical information into semantic information. We see some physical objects, we need touse our perception/ cognation in our inside language system to transfer this physicalinformation into language. From this perspective, if we want to transfer the same physicalinformation into different languages, the perception/ cognation we use may be different,which means that people having different dominant languages may have differentperception/ cognation.Hope my understanding could help! ^-^"
59,38,20170321,6,"Thanks for the introduction of an interesting tool called IFTTT, which is an intellectualhuman agent. I am interested in this useful web-based service, so I tried it immediately.IFTTT is an initialism for If This Then That. Typical apps might send e-mails if the IFTTTuser uses a certain hashtag, or copy photos on Facebook to user's album if someone tags theuser in that photo.Just as you mentioned, we mainly have two kinds of agents- human agents and digitalagents. Human agents are from embodiment to abstraction; and digital agents are fromabstraction to embodiment. Because the direction of human??s understanding and machine??sunderstanding are opposite, there are often huge barriers in information transmissionbetween nontechnical people and machine. Luckily, with IFTTT, nontechnical people cantransfer information to machine with simple human language rather than complicatedprogramming codes.Hope my idea could help! ^-^"
59,38,20170321,6,"Thanks for your introduction of general process of sentiment analysis!You mentioned the first step of analysis- use import.io or other programs to collect theinformation from the Internet. However, you met some problems at this step. You tried tocollect a small set of data from a forum, but users in the forum use slangs to express theirfeeling, which is far away from the ideal case.To solve this problem, I think we can create a dictionary which categorises these slangs intodifferent groups, just as the categorisation of adjectives in WordNet. For example, we cancategorise ??WTF??(which stands for what the fxxk) into category with the label ??hate??.Hope me suggestions could help. ^-^"
2,34,20170320,6,"I quite agree with the point of Ambiguity. Clearly, there are other perspectives that NLP has to face.For example the problem of determine the Language Pattern: in our daily life, the best answer to ??Could you pass the salt to me??? surely are response like ??of course??. However, according to the grammatical rule, computer probably choose ??Yes, I can.?? as a response, which could be a stiff choice although it is the standard positive feedback of questions like ??Can?????. In this case, not only the computer needs to understand the meaning, but also it should know the most suitable feedback in real life situations."
34,34,20170321,6,"Thank you for sharing your insight. From my perspective, it is a tradeoff between quality and quantity. On the one hand, online forum is so giant that it reflects thoughts from millions of players. Collecting comments in existed forums is relatively easy, if comparing with conducting experiments or distributing questionnaires.Surely, unlike articles or experiments full of valuable contexts and brilliant insights, most posts in online forum expresses emotion but not truth, like player??s anger or doubt. The choices of words in their comments are more casual, more sensual, even more irrational.Considering this circumstance, I suppose sentiment analysis can be a good candidate in the PX analysis. Plus, some data mining techniques like data cleaning can also be done in pre-process step to filter out most no-go information. Actually i think this problem is quite common in many cases of social network analysis. Maybe look into relevant cases of social analysis and see how they works our cleaning the data could help."
38,34,20170321,6,"Glad that you brought up the idea of training and testing in machine learning. In most cases, testing data and training data is required to be strictly separated, which means using the same data for training and testing is prohibited (is like self prove).I do agree with the advantages of reusing the data to do training and validate. Maybe when a set of new data coming in, we first use our existed model to do testing. After all the training has been done, we can reuse the testing data for training, so that the data can be reused."
57,34,20170321,6,"I think those points serve as central pillars in UI design industry. If I try to justify those points in popular UI design cases, I can find out that those successes all follow the principals and take them as their baseline. However, I think the hardest part in UI design is to keep balance between those points. i.e. if an app UI design team wants to increase their universal usability in other platforms like Android or Windows, the most straight forward way to do it is to transplant their app and make them suitable for the local requirements. In the same time, they may suffer from problems which arises from ??being universal??, like lower stability and performance, increase of size etc."
59,34,20170321,6,"Thank you for providing this website as a application to show transformation between human language and digital information here. Personally I guess this website implements some NLP techniques to achieve this transformation here. It first separates words into several categories like nonce and verbs then try to grab the whole meaning by identify the phrases and the linking words. In our real life, there are many applications which are quite similar to the example you brought to table, like Cartona and Siri.By the way, if Gakki get married one day, please help me to send regards of Lannisters."
59,34,20170321,6,"I think some approaches in data mining may help solve some of your questions. In data mining, I think the pre-processing step of data is very essential. Often, it firstly checks the validity of filled data by some type/range/mandatory constrains (i.e. when fill a questionnaire for online database, malicious user may write SQL instructions like DROP Table* instead of providing the legit content), and it can check the completeness of words and sentences, the uniformity of language, even filter out meaningless or duplicated relies to clean the collected data."
2,59,20170320,6,"The idea in the post is quite impressive. We are in an era with full of information and at the same time, full of rubbish. I think it is true that in twitter or other social media, but for big data analysis, the researches may not pay so much attention on this area. For the information in twitter or other social media, they are more like semantic information than digital information. It is hard for machines to deal with semantic information but it is easy for them to analyze digital information. Maybe the analysis on social media do help us to get some essential information but it is not efficient."
19,59,20170320,6,"Naive Bayes Classifier is a very basic point in machine. It is only a classifier. And also, the ??naive?? in its name show the status of this classifier. I think the reason why it is common in text classification is because in text analysis, many strange conditions may happen. So, it is important to use a simple but adaptable algorithm to do the classification. Maybe there exist a more powerful algorithm for the text classification than this one, but people have not known it yet.You can do some analysis on this area, find the more suitable one and speak aloud that Naive Bayes Classifier is out of date."
69,59,20170320,6,"I cannot agree with your point any more. UX is very important in product design, like game design, kitchen utensils, and so on. There are already some books to teach or inform you how to design a awesome product with nice user experience. If you have interested in this area, you may have a try. As far as I am concerned, I am very surprised that your blog design is very user friendly, which will lead to excellent user experience. Compared with other blogs i have visited, it is easy to have the overview of all of your posts. Some other blogs put all the details of their posts in one page, which makes me feel uncomfortable and hard to choose a single blog."
13,59,20170320,6,"It is a concise summary of three modes of information. I agree with your idea mentioned at the end of this post. Digital information speed up the spreading process of the other two information. With the help of Internet, we can share our idea with people on the other side of the earth. With the help of Internet, doctors can do surgery thousands of miles away with accurate perception of physical information of patient's body. It is an amazing era. People try every means to translate other kinds of information into digital information. For example, Taobao transfers the physical market into digital market, which can make great fortune. Maybe one day in future, we can experience the whole digital word, like described in movie The Matrix."
69,59,20170320,6,"Thanks for sharing. I think Naive Bayes Test Classification is a good bet although it has this problem. Actually, i think in reality, human's decision making method performs the same as Naive Bayes Test Classification. We, human being, will also replace some complex factors by using the assumptions we obtain from our previous experience. So it may be possible to use some assumptions to reduce the computation complexity in the algorithm, like Naive Bayes Test Classification. Every sword has two sides. Maybe the computers nowadays cannot afford more complex computation, so using a low-cost algorithm could optimize the result."
19,59,20170320,6,"HaHa! Interesting topic, interesting example and funny comments. Seriously speaking, there is a standard gesture language which is widely used in different countries. I know it is different from what you have mentioned. The physical language you mentioned here is more like the natural actions that reflect your mind. It is not a systematic language. The difference between men and women in body language reflects the different thinking method between man and woman. Maybe for men, direct expression is the best and this will impact the way they use body language. For women, sorry I don??t know. If I can figure out what females are thinking, maybe I will not be single right now. ?r(?s???t)?q"
34,59,20170321,6,"Thanks for your sharing. You show us a general player experience model in this blog. And at the same time, you briefly introduce the history about the player experience. I have also read some papers about player experience. They mainly use survey data or interview data to do the analysis. They do omit the importance of online forums. It may be an interesting research area in future. However, I think that collecting data from the forums is good but not efficient. By using survey, the researches can collect data about some specific area, but when using online forums, you may be at a loss. I think there may be no mature procedures or popular methods for analyzing data from online forums in the past and maybe nowadays. I believe there will be an outstanding method future. Maybe it's your method. Do you think so?"
34,59,20170321,6,"Thanks for your sharing. In this post, you mainly introduce one tool to help computers understand the sentences and one model for sentiment analysis. It's amazing! I have never heard about the first tool before. It seems like magic! The post is concise and impressive. For the first tool, it cares about the relationship between words which will greatly help the sentiment analysis to cluster the attitude to certain objects. For example, by combining the tool and the model, we can not only find the users' attitude towards the product and can also know the detail comments on certain objects such as picture, lens and battery. Also in the post, you say that the negative and positive label is not enough. Maybe translate these into certain value will improve the performance. However, it may be hard to evaluate different adjectives because everyone has his own standard to evaluate. How do you think about this question?"
15,59,20170321,6,"I agree with your idea at the end of this post. I think the beginning history is also pretty interesting. At the beginning of this post, author use his own to describe how physical information, semantic information and digital information come from. It is concise and it do list important reasons for the transferring among these three modes of information. Digital information is exactly the description in this post, I think. The digital information also contains information that human may not understand. In my opinion, the first task for digital information is to optimize the transmitting rate or accuracy among the machines. We, human beings and the inventors of computers, also need agent to translate digital information, which is also described in this post."
15,59,20170321,6,"Thanks for sharing your ideas. I am pretty impressed by the ""Semantic functions"" part of this post. In this part, author use several vivid examples to explain semantic function is partly based on the physical affordance. And as mentioned in the post, we can find that the semantic function actually reveal a human(designer)-environment(product)-human(user) line rather than direct human-environment interaction. This makes me think about more. The model we have learned in textbook or in lecture is abstract. If we can analyze real situations by using the models, we may have better understanding about theories. Thanks, Richard."
38,59,20170321,6,"Thanks for sharing your method about how to do opinion mining. The method you provided here is quite efficient according to your example. You mention that if something miss in the (entity, aspect, sentiment, opinion holder, time) tuple, there will be some problems. I think it is right but it also depends on how you analyze the data. For some restrict condition, one element loss will lead to deletion. But if you are doing simply semantic analysis or opinion mining, the element time or opinion holder may not be necessary. It is only my naive opinion, how about you?"
38,59,20170321,6,"Thanks for sharing your idea. I am interested in the topic of memory. First let me answer the question at the end. Can we trust our own memory? My answer is no. According to your description in the middle part of the post, you say that the scatter elements in your memory reconstructed the previous scene on Cheung Chau Island. You only recognize those elements at that time. You may lose some other environment elements. For this scene, it is ok because the important elements are all ready, but if you lose some essential environment elements, the memory to you is not true. The memory cannot reflect the reality of that time. So, it is possible to guide someone's memory to wrong result by using some psychological methods to let victim to forget some key element. How do you think?"
2,78,20170321,6,"A very interesting post. I really agree with your point that our cognition is highly influenced by the environment. When we play card games such as poker, our decision will always be highly influenced by other player??s reaction.But, on the other hand,I am really confused about your idea that this influence is caused by the cognitive overload. Based on your post, I can not find any relationship between them. Due to the cognitive overload, a very good idea that designing a low working memory capacity schema is helpful to the learners. We should learn things step by step, we must learn to walk before we can run."
41,14,20170319,6,"if we think deeply, we can realize the translation function base on a chinese dictionary which made by a group of people, I can sure that they may not know the exact meaning of ??X??huan sh??ng y??g??r??n?? in Cantonese because they speak mandarin instead of Cantonese. In Cantonese, there are 4 different meaning but not in mandarin. Also, the slang used in 80s is different from the slang used nowadays, it keeps changing from time to time. Generally, we can identify which location they are from and what generation they are by slang, but different people with different personalities may use different words to express themselves, so it is not possible to translate his or her speech before having enough communication with him or her. we can only use the machine learning method at this time."
48,14,20170320,6,"In my opinion, cyber-bullying is wrong, the reason of cyber-bullying maybe related to the atmosphere including family, friends and school. For example, some secondary school propose their student to exclude the students who have poor academic performance, maybe it is because of the interest of the school, or helping their student to insist their values and prevent them from getting into trouble, but we can know different form of education affect the point of view of the people a lot."
40,14,20170320,6,"Nowadays, the sentiment analysis is used frequently for recommendation systems. I afraid that the people can only receive the specific content which related to their feedback. Sometimes, they may misunderstand the trend of the crowd and think that they are the majority, because the recommendation system group up the people who have the same interest. it may not able to help the people to understand their crowd."
40,14,20170320,6,"Contextual computing greatly relies on GPS and online map including Google map and QQ map, By getting the coordinates of the current position, the time and the people stay with you, the appropriate restaurant and shop can be recommended, much more time can be saved."
40,14,20170320,6,"It is very interesting that there are lots of applications in our daily life which is related to the semantic information. But the point is how we can provide user-friendly product to the user by using signs and symbols, how is the user experience when using the product and how we can provide fast and accurate information to the user who has specific need."
40,14,20170320,6,"I am much more focus on how we can share information to others and searching the information in a very fast ways. Apart from searching the information by using some keywords , the recommendation system is also very common in use by some social media. For specific time and specific place , the system can recommends different information to the users. And I also focus on how fast we can share the information to others and adding functions that can help us to evaluate how??s accuracy and reliability the information shared by others."
48,14,20170320,6,"Lots of research is focused on how is the relationship of different entities. Some clustering algorithms help us a lot in many researchers . This is widely used in finding similar species. People are no longer need to spend a lot of time in finding interesting articles or information they needed. However, we just need to spend time on filtering the useless information."
20,14,20170321,6,"By considering the importance of knowing how rare the word is. It is closely related to the term weighing. The more rarer the word is, the more important the word is. We can use this algorithm to find out what is the thesis of the articles. It is really convenient that huge amount of data has been processed and we just need to use short time to search what we exactly want to find."
20,14,20170321,6,"I??m glad to have a course what is teaching about how we can relate psychology and also programming language with each other. Be an engineer, usually we just received some functional requirements and starting our programming works. The Seldom think about how we can design a user friendly product. In this course we had a chance to know how to improve the user experience. Just using appropriate algorithm and different approach to fulfill the criteria in different situations."
41,14,20170321,6,"Keep practicing and practising the programming language , gain more experience on different field such as data processing and using different algorithm to process big data. Try to develop some mobile apps and also some web applications. No matter which programming language we used, we can have a basic idea of how to solve the problem very quickly."
41,14,20170321,6,"Of course nowadays social media has become a way for us to connect with the society , which we can get all of the information we need, however just bear in mind that the Facebook friends we have does not indicate we have friends in the real world, just spending time on meeting with friends and don??t be so intense on how many ??like?? we get in the Facebook, we can have some great friendship in the real world but not just some virtual friends."
25,55,20170320,6,"Thanks for your sharing and I know more about contextual computing. From the article, it is so true that contextual computing becomes more and more common these days. It leads information access to be something much more simple and bringing a lot of convenience to we human. Just as the iBeacons mentioned, this technology can help detecting the surrounding environment and link to different digital devices for data transferrals which can save up people??s time in data collection and further data analysis. I believe iBeacon will surely be improving the coming years. As a result digital devices will soon be people??s essential things in their life and this will then surely replace different things, such as wallet and key."
53,55,20170320,6,"Nowadays with the advancement of technology, there are more and more tools invented that bring a lot of convenience to people. Just as the online recommendation system, it is so true that this technology has been emerging into people's ""internet"" life. The system is able to track the searching habit of users and display different suggestions that the system predicts products the user may like or the people that the user may know. This can help those users who are having difficulties in making decisions. At the same time, tailored a unique recommendations of respective users for a better user experience and at the same time aiding different companies for promotions. To conclude, recommendation system is really very useful and I do agree that such system's development is surely a huge market in promoting and selling the products."
20,55,20170320,6,"Thank you for your sharing. As what mentioned during class and from your blogpost, I surely agree that using matrix to predict the rating of a user is a good way in building a webpage. As the type of advertisements shown on the web can be customised according to the user's behaviour when using the internet. So, users are able to know similar products or links that suggested to them which can help them in making decisions with such recommendation system."

People can easily read different information as well as knowing about current status of their friends through this social media platform. I found this article interesting as letting me know how Facebook display the results obtained through the internal recommendation system. Hence, with the system, the five characteristics including Degree of interest of the fans page, Performance of the post, Popularity of the fans page, Similarity of the user??s post and Posting time., will be used to determine the news feed contents. This can display a unique user experience for each and every users which can attract more users to browse their Facebook more frequently."

This can also target the right customers for their products through the analysis of the data collections from the recommended system as well as different comments. Also, this can help to monitor different social media platforms for a better overview for an object or product in an efficient and effective way. This will surely build a better user experiences and at the same time allow the companies to get expose to more different users that can increase their product sales."
45,25,20170320,6,"Thanks for your sharing. I agreed that IoT is being the trend of the market and it will be more widely used in the future. Besides the three main area that is using the IoT well, many other industries have planing how to apply IoT on their products. For example, iBeacon will be one them. It can benefit on the stores. This allow people to get the information for the products without the help. For example, you may find a favorite shoe in a shop but you need to know if there is your size in the shop. In this moment, you may ask for the help from the sales. With the help of iBeacon, you can get the information with your mobile devices immediately. IoT seems to have a colorful future, do you think so?"
55,25,20170320,6,"Thanks for your sharing. I agree that digital technologies improve the education environment. Online chatting platform allows the interaction between teachers and students. Besides the technologies mentioned above, machine learning can also help on education.

Online shopping has many benefits for people such as goods are cheaper, and people be more convenient to shop rather than walking around shopping malls whole day, Online shopping is attractive has its reason. I have seen an article said that online shops have no-taxes-charged, free shipping offers and the types of goods are much more than traditional shops. These makes more people willing to go online shopping.Thanks for your sharing!"
68,45,20170316,6,"I agree that machine learning is important to us and it helps people to solve problems. Machine learning can be used in so many ways for solving problems. It is important as it has a strong computation power, and not expensive. Once we complete the training of the machine, it??s possible to quickly and automatically produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, more accurate results, even on a very large scale.

It can help us to analyze the frequency of words in our project.Thanks for your sharing."
2,13,20170318,6,"It is an interesting point of view that ??the robots will become the natural extension in our human society??. I agree that technology is not only enhancing the interaction between human and machine, but also transferring job structure and remodelling the relationship between human beings in our community. As the writer says, it is possible that young teenagers in the future will have a quiet different cognition towards artificial intelligence. Robots might be an indispensable part of their life. Their good friends, teachers, and pet dogs can be AI rather than real persons or real dogs. It sounds horrible to me but it might result in a new life style and people will get used to it very quickly. What is more, I am quite optimistic about the labour market in the future, even though AI will replace many manual jobs. Because at that time, new jobs will be created and the transformation of the employment structure will surely emerge."

The purpose of technology development is to provide services to human beings. As long as the product can bring convenience to us, we would like to make use of it and ease our life. No one want to use a product that actually makes our life harder! If online shopping needs complex procedures rather than ??Buy now with 1-click??, everyone will go to grocery or shopping mall directly. Therefore, the task of designers is to think from users?? perspectives and conceive a plan to meet the corresponding demands. However, it is quite challenging because sometimes we cannot understand ourselves!"
57,13,20170318,6,"It is true that semantic information can describe both abstract concepts and substantial objects. Because to human beings, semantic information has the strongest capability on concept description (e.g. ??table?? refers to an object but it is actually a concept as a word). Semantic meaning is almost the most commonly used factor that helps human to understand information. It is a tube for human to contact with the world. Therefore, no matter what type of information it is, whenever people want to understand it, they would like to transform it into a type with semantic affordance. This dependence also expands the meanings that the semantic information can contain."
55,13,20170319,6,"As far as I am concerned, it is possible that machines will replace human one day if we lose the control of them. Although machines can only perform limited functions at present, they will be much powerful in the future once we teach them to learn like a human. Then, it will enrich knowledge by itself without our control. Someone believes that machine does not have self-awareness and all its operations depend on human input. However, what if one day it is given the ability to grow up on its own? Since we want machines to perform as a human in many cases, they are taught to imitate human thinking. Once the neural network technology enables machine to be smart enough to threaten the existence of human, it will be too late for us to stop the exploration. Therefore, besides seeing the advantages it brings us, we should regard this technology with reverence."
19,13,20170320,6,"HAHA! It is my first time to notice that we may need different body language decoder system for different people! Everyone has his or her own way of expressing. Sometimes we misunderstand others because of our recognition differences. Linguists can even recognize a person by studying his/her frequently used words. Our technology in language analysis nowadays mainly focuses on the expressions in common use so that it can be widely adapted to the majority of users. Considering individual characteristic factors will only increase the complexity of the system. However, constructing a specific learner for each person could be a prospective research direction to develop the language analysis system. Machines will understand people from his/her perspective so that we can eliminate the recognition differences between people and machines."
57,13,20170320,6,"Considering the gap between digital information and perception of human, it is necessary for designers to create products that help human to interact with computer easily. Product design does not only represent the appearance or the layout, but also play the role of a guide that leads our end users to follow the procedures and fulfil their purposes. For example, when we are shopping online, we would like to check categories listed on one webpage. If the catalogue includes too many branches, it will be too specific for customers to choose a proper tag. In contrast, if it is too general, referring to everything actually refers to nothing. To create a useful guide, we need to study target users and adapt our strategy toward corresponding behaviors/habits."
25,13,20170321,6,"Thanks for sharing! Recommendation system is quite a hot topic nowadays and machine learning is one of the most significant techniques applied. Thanks to this studying ability, it can help business companies to figure out the latent information hidden behind users?? daily actions. There was a news that a shop named Target sent coupons for baby clothes to a teen girl before her father realized her pregnancy. By doing data mining, companies can retrieve purchasing patterns of their customers and develop corresponding investment strategies for target groups. Therefore, an efficient machine learning method will definitely play an important role in business activities."

2,13,20170321,6,"We have to admit that natural language is very complex thanks to the wisdom of our ancestors. Language is one of the most important tools that we used to communicate with others. So does the interaction between human and computer. However, there always exists a gap in between because of the difference between computer language and natural language. If computer cannot understand our requests, it cannot respond with a proper feedback. According to the famous Turing test, a good AI machine should have the ability to ??exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human?? [1]. We have already invented several types of intelligent robots nowadays (both software and robot entity) and some of them are able to hold simple conversations with human. Although we still can figure out their identities based on their ??stupid?? answers, it is a good beginning and the study of Natural Language Processing will definitely stimulate the development of Artificial Intelligence.

35,27,20170315,6,"hi as an information engineering student. I totally agree the point ""the precision is concerned in exchange information"" is a big problem for engineering student. It is the cyber security problems nowadays. As many information exchanges in Internet There are many sensitive information like password, ID card no, or credit card will be sent through the internet. Some bad guys are trying to steal the information for criminal use. They will use lots of method like XSS, CSRF or phishing website to gain the trust of website or the user for giving the information.Therefore, the encryption is an important role for protecting the user in the world. And it's what we are going to learn to do as an engineering students."
67,27,20170315,6,"Yes, I totally agree of your point of ""The idea of social communication software is to enclose the distance between people"". However, we are misusing the technology.I have a similar experience at my mother's birthday. I invited her to go to restaurant and ate birthday dinner with my family. However, my sister and she just were keeping swapping their phone and chatting with other people. I thought it was not respecting to me and I felt a bit disappointed. Therefore, I have told them to put down the phone together and chat to them. And everything backed to my childs' time.In my opinion, we should express our feeling honestly to our family and be a role model to let them follow. Then they will follow and listen to you."
32,27,20170315,6,"Yes, I got your point. Nowadays people are keep on exploring the boundaries of computers. AI can perform lots of jobs and facilitate our life. However, I am worried about the over-developing of AI will lead to reaching its extreme, then it reverses its course. There are lots of movies and books mentioned about the people over-rely on the AI. Finally the AI ruled or destroyed human.In my opinions, AI can improve our life and discover the world but we cannot let them to own our lives. Sometimes we need to do something ourselves is meaningful. If we give all stuffs for AI. AI will not need us anymore."
32,27,20170315,6,"It is a good example! Taking Mc Donald as the example can let us easily to understand the importance of Sentiment Analysis, not only benefit to the company, but also to our customers because it meets our need ! When Mc Donald kept on selling new kinds of bun and food, the company listen the feedback by Sentiment Analysis. Therefore, the company can promote new buns with similar popular products or just resell the products to attract customer to eat.In recent days, Mc Donald has stopped selling three products which I like it also.... I think the company can hear the feedback of customer by this analysis. And a few moments, these three products will be sold again."
63,65,20170316,6,"Thank you for your sharing. I agree that being a computer science student, knowing how human interact with information could help us to understand how to collect the data for machine learning. Let's me explain more on how to collect data after learning HII.In the theory of HII, the interaction of information could be classified into three areas: 1. human-to-human interaction,2. machine-to-machine interaction 3. human-to-machine interaction. For instance, if you were Facebook and you wanted to recommend some products to your users, then you could collect data in above three areas. i.e collecting chatting record between users (human-to-human interaction), collecting user buying history to see what products user has bought in the past (human-to-machine interaction) and analyzing the trend of products by checking the social media posted on Facebook (machine-to-machine interaction)By doing that, you could apply the theory of HII and apply what you learned in machine learning."
54,65,20170316,6,"Thank you for your sharing. In my opinion, not only did the frequent of human interaction increase due to rapid technology development, but also affect the way how people interact with other. For example, before the invention of the internet, the human could only interact other by direct chatting or calling each other. There is a lack of machine-to-machine interaction. Nonetheless, after the invention of WWW, different platform are connected to each other, the information could be shared, embedded on them freely. Besides, people are able to message others, video-chatting through the network. This also explains why the information are now exchanged more efficiently so I think that we should enjoy the benefits and keep learning and updating ourselves."
26,65,20170316,6,"Thank you for your informative and illustrative blog.Indeed, the applications of content analysis are now everywhere in our daily life. And I agree that in the short future, using the power of machine learning, the efficiency and accuracy of content analysis could be improved in great extent. Look at the Siri and Google Assistant, they are newly developed artificial intelligent assistant in recent years. Not only could they help us to perform searching, the could also understand what we talked and give us a rapid response. This is very exciting and stunning fact showing us the content analysis could be very useful in coming future."
13,65,20170316,6,"Thank you for your ideas, especially the point that explain why sentiment analysis related to exploring the internal world of human beings. I have seen a news about Suicide Prevention which shows how Facebook find out the people who have the intention to commit suicide by analyzing the sentence in their post and its comments. According to the New York Times, Facebook??s researchers found that posts with negative associations typically received long, empathetic comments. If Facebook succeeds, it could prove why we need sentiment analysis and it helps lots of people in the world."
8,65,20170317,6,"Thank you for your opinion.Machine learning could be generally classified into two types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The first one is like what you have mentioned: it needs a label for training data. However, for the second one, it does not require a label to train the model. K-mean algorithm and EM algorithm are the two example used in unsupervised learning.Moreover, I think although, at this moment, the processing speed of machine learning is still slow in many different areas, it is hard to say whether it will beat human after 20 years. Taking the alphaGo as an example, by applying the machine learning, the reaction speed of alphaGo is much faster than the most skillful Go player in the world. So I do believe that the processing speed of machine learning could be dramatically increased,In addition, Microsoft is now creating a concept graph: https://concept.research.microsoft.com/I think in the short future, the machine could imitate how human recognizes an object. i.e by past experience and concepts."
77,65,20170317,6,"Thank you for your summary of the lecture notes.Maybe I could help you to elaborate more about the formula for entropy.In lecture, the information content for event E is defined as I(E) = log (P(E))Entropy is defined as H = -?? p(x) log p (x).One important concept is that if you know nothing for something ( i.e every possible event E shares same probability), then the uncertainty will be higher and the received message contains higher entropy.I suggest you could give us more example and share some opinion that why should we learn about entropy. Hope it could help."
24,65,20170317,6,"Thank you for your sharing.I agree that learning HII could help us design a better user interface. Nowadays many companies emphasize the importance of user interface and user experience. Just like Facebook, Google and Amazon, they hire the UI/UX engineer with a high salary. Why user interface is important? Not only it could enhance the quality and the efficiency of the software, it also increases the efficient of interacting between human and machine. For example, a easy-to-use forum application could encourage users to post more and comment to others. Conversely, if the system is not well designed, users may find it difficult to use and hence, lower information interaction. Therefore, learning HII is vital for us to have a better understanding of user interface design."
25,65,20170318,6,"Thank you for your good summary of the machine learning.As a computer science students, I am also interested in this topic as well. Since you have clearly described the key different and features of these two types of machine learning method, I would like to discuss some popular machine learning algorithmaccording to the http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/top-10-machine-learning-algorithms,the top 10 machine learning algorithm are:1.Linear regression2.Logistic regression3.k-means4.SVMs5.Random Forests6.Matrix Factorization/SVD7.Gradient Boosted Decision Trees/Machines8.Naive Bayes9.Artificial Neural Networks10. Bayesian NetworksMost of them are supervised learning algorithm, including Linear regression, Logistic regression, SVMs, Random Forests, Decision Tree, Navie Bayes etc.The unsupervised learning with the highest ranking is K-means algorithm.Here is the interesting demonstration of K-means algorithm:http://shabal.in/visuals/kmeans/5.htmlYou could see that K-mean algorithm first randomly pick up K central points (green in color). Then assign all other points to their nearest K points and update the central points. Keep looping this process until the result converges or unchanged.Although it is simple, it is sometimes good enough in some situations. (e.g points are separated very long to each other)"
5,65,20170318,6,"Thank you for your thought.I agree in the modern society, we must have critical thinking and do not 100% trust any news from one single source. Take a look at how TVB news interviewed with citizen: www.thestandnews.com/society/?u????????-???L????tvb???????x/In this cases, you may know that even with Video, the media could still make their personal opinion or stance. Even the citizen mentioned 10 drawbacks of policy address with only 1 benefits, the news could choose that 1 benefits to report. Audience without knowing the fact will think that the interviewer supported the policy address. So in this case, it shows that why we could not trust once's news for 100%.In addition, I think that you could mention more how this relates to semantic analysis, otherwise it will be too far from what we have learnt in the lecture. Hope this helps!"
7,65,20170318,6,"Thank you for your information for the augmented reality. It is a very good brief introduction to let us understand what is AR.I believe most people have heard of Pokemon-Go. It is a very popular mobile game using the technology of AR. In the game, the virtual object ""Pokemon"" will appear in the real environment. This setup let the users think that the Pokemon really exists in our world! This interesting feature has successfully attracted million of users to download it.However, someone thinks that AR might not be as popular as VR (Virtual Reality). According to http://www.digi-capital.com/news/2016/01/augmentedvirtual-reality-revenue-forecast-revised-to-hit-120-billion-by-2020/#.WNUqBRKGPrg, the increase rate of Digi-capital of AR is very low compared to VR.This indicates that AR technique is still not prevalent."
53,65,20170318,6,"Thank you for your eye-catching posts.To me or to any other computer scientists, analyzing the Cantonese Sentences is definitely much harder than English. However, every languages has the ambiguity problem. In english, there are many words with multiple meaning too! So I believe that the ambiguity problem is not the main reason for Cantonese to be difficult to analysis."
14,65,20170318,6,"Thank you for your great example. Yes, I agree with you that euclidean distance takes less processing time than cosine similarity. However, I could not understand why you said that Respondent 1 is the most similar to respondent 3 because using euclidean distance is much more effective. In my opinion, using less time does not mean that it is better or more accurate. Instead, it depends on what you want to get. According to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19410270/vector-space-model-cosine-similarity-vs-euclidean-distance, Cosine similarity is used to determine the ""preference"" / ""style"" / ""sentiment"" / ""latent variable"" of the vector, while the euclidean distance is used to see how strong it is towards that direction. One example is when you want to classify the category of 10 billions books, you will use Cosine similarity rather than using euclidean distance. But if you want to check how similar is the two document, you will use the euclidean-distance algorithm. e.g plagiarism"
69,40,20170320,6,"This lecture is quite different from the lectures that we always attended to. We seldom have time to go outside and walk around and apply some theory into the things we see in the campus. For me having a chance to apply the theory we learnt into daily life is important because it can enhance my interpretation about the context. Without application I think those theories are something that are not easy to understand because I cannot image it. But through this lecture I have a rough picture about context, at least I can know recognize which object in the photo is belonging to an subject, circumstance etc. This is a good experience attending this special lecture."
73,40,20170321,6,"For a machine, it is not easy to recognize which comment or opinion is positive or negative. And therefore some methods are suggested that you just mentioned in order to let the machine to recognize that. Time is still needed for machines to ??learn"" how to know a comment which is positive or negative, however using human power to process those comments is not efficient and it may cost a lot of money. Also, as you mentioned, the machines may need to know about the evaluation objects that imply into the context. I think the technology of machine learning is not that developed for analyzing those evaluation objects, time is needed to handle those problems."
9,40,20170321,6,"Digital information is more and more popular in nowadays, the chance that we need to communicate through the computer is more and more since those machines can convenience our daily life. The machines need to convert our message into digital data and then send to the another machine and finish some task that we want to finish. This kind of information will be increased in the future."
14,40,20170317,6,"I agree that the authority may affect how people express their point of view. The authority mainly have the power or something that can make your life worse, for example if you do not agree with your teacher you may be boycotted or your scores will be easily deducted. And the appearance of Internet can generally hide your identity and exchange your real opinion to the others. Also it is a convenient way to grab information, at least the information you receive is not only given by the authority."
48,40,20170320,6,"In my opinion, it is quite often that people may attack the others through the Internet by commenting the posts in social media since no one will know who they are and it seems not easy to trace whether who is exactly the attacker but this is the reason that people can express their opinion freely through the net.It is not easy to avoid from the attacks from the Internet since people may have different stance to the topic, maybe one of the methods can reduce the attack from cyber bullying is becoming rational to discuss, at least the words you use are ??rational"" in the others?? mind. We need to be careful if we are going to express our views."
58,40,20170320,6,Totally agree that contextual computing will be more and more important in the future. Contextual computing provides something more that convenience our daily life like recommending videos that we may have interest in youtube etc. and iBeacon is becoming more popular in order to building a smart city. I hope this technology can make our daily life in different aspects more convenient.
25,40,20170321,6,"I have the same idea that VR technologies will be more important and popular in the future. Nowadays VR technologies are mainly applied for gaming like PSVR etc., however actually VR technologies can make our life become more convenient in different aspects like watching a VR video for purchasing a building and having physical training everywhere that you mentioned. I hope those technologies may apply into different parts of our daily life not only for playing video games."
42,21,20170321,6,"Yes I agree social network is very important for human. It becomes a vital panel for human to exchange information doubtlessly. News, gossips, articles and funny videos are widely spread on social network. It??s very easy to access.As you mentioned in your post, by collecting data from these social networks, we could gain lots of interesting information. For instance, by collecting pages that a Facebook user liked we could understand his habit or interest. Thus Online Advertisement company would show advertisements according users?? interest. Through these ??tailor made?? approach, it raised the clicking rate of advertisements. It??s hard to imagine there are loads of calculations and data involved behind an online advertisement"
18,63,20170321,6,"I agree that the interaction between human and computer will become more humanlike. We usually need to read the user manual before using the device as the control is different from motion of human body. In smartphone, it uses gesture as an input which simulates human motion as mentioned in the above article. Voice assistant such as Siri and Google Assistant is good example that people are trying to develop a system that can simulate the communication way of human. The most difficult part is to make it think like a human in order to get a useful response to the user."
2,63,20170321,6,"This is a very interesting post. The idea mentioned in this post is totally against the traditional views of cognition of human. Many people think that the way that we react to a situation is based on our experiences or memories. So, we can react faster when we see a same thing again. This is a fantastic discovery which can help us to think more about the human cognition. And I think that embodied cognition usually occurs when people first see the thing so that they try to use their physical feeling to help them analyze the information. Thank you for you sharing"
26,63,20170321,6,"I totally agree with you as the recommender system is widely used in our daily life. The size of information is rapidly expanding nowadays so it is very difficult for a user to handle such amount of data themselves. To process the information, recommender system helps users to find out what they may wanted easily and faster by analyzing the users?? behavior on the Internet. However, as a user, we may feel curious about what data is being collected by the system. Privacy is also an important issue on Internet security and people should careful handle such problems when developing the recommender system."
66,63,20170321,6,"Performing analysis on social media is a useful way to find out the trend of human activities since social media has become part of our daily life. People use it to share their hobbies, activities and opinions etc., and we can easily collect and process those data using different way learnt from the lecture. Of course, learning how to analyze the content of the information on the Internet is exciting and important as it can be used in many field of information technologies such as recommender system and machine learning. As an engineering student, we should well prepare ourselves to deal with such amount of information on the Internet."
37,41,20170316,6,"Hi Luiyan. Thank for your sharing. Upon those days, my Facebook status was all about the news from the Mahjong Society as well. That is because most of my friend liked, or shared the news published by the online media.There is similar case like the ??Flip Flops Designed Competition"" held by New Asia Collage. In that case, my friends from HKU also know it and discuss it with me.I do agree that if the online media or the famous people who share the news will make the news become viral. But I wonder, these kind of news were only exposed and spread out in a group of people (i.e. University related people). The reason why I have this thought is because when I share the above news to a people who are now working. He responded me that he did not know anything at all.In order to let every Hong Kong people to know a news, I think the most important thing is the content. For example, Election of Hong Kong Chief Executive, which is very important. Then, both the traditional and the online media will report for it.Regarding to your words that maybe one day people will not using traditional media, I have some reservations. I think that the traditional media will decline days by days but not be eliminated. People will watch TV in future right? Then TV news which is traditional media should be available in future. That??s what I think so far."
10,41,20170316,6,"Hi Winsome. Thank for your sharing. Regarding with you points, I have some reservations. I do agree that digital environment will be our trend. But I don??t think traditional store is losing its attractiveness. For an example, will you buy Salmon Sashimi in Taobao?I think that both online and traditional store has it own strength and weakness. But they are not in mutually exclusive position but coexist. In fact, they make, develop a better environment for store and customers. It is very often that customers used to get in traditional store to have experience with the products. And then they look for discount in online store to buy them. What do you think?"
14,41,20170316,6,"Wow. It seems fantastic. My previous blog ??How much can Sentimental Analysis do??? just mentioned the accuracy of translation from Chinese to Digital Information. I think that Chinese language is difficult for computer to analyse. As mentioned in my blog post, one Chinese sentences can be explained in four different meaning. But after reading your blog post, I know that the computer will list out all of the probability that the Chinese sentence means. And then after running a scoring function, the computer determine the meaning of the sentences by the scoring function (probability).But I wonder, in such case, although the computer knows that one Chinese sentences can have different meanings, it will only determine it as one meaning. How about the others meaning which are still possible too? Is that the computer will analyse the whole paragraph in the scoring function?Moreover, there are sometimes pun, also called paronomasia, is a form of word play that exploits multiple meanings of a term, or of similar-sounding words. But in the case above, computer only explain it in one meaning. I think this is the limitation of the scoring function so far. Will there be a scoring function for pun?In case you are interested, the below link is my blog. It talk about analysis in Chinese too.

19,41,20170320,6,"Hi Vanessa. Thanks for your sharing. Your article reminded me the same taught in Introduction to Operation Systems. There are several type of scheduling, like First-In-First-Out, Last-In-First-Out, Shortest-Path-First, Round-Robin, etc. As discussed, most of the schedulers will imply Round-Robin because it can satisfy most of the tasks and with an acceptable waiting time for each task. However, there are no the best scheduling as it depends on the environment (i.e. task).When it comes to classifier, they are the same. The advantage of using Naive Bayes is the fact that it is a simple machine learning technique, with a linear training time. Compared to other classifiers training time which is expensive iterative approximation, the cost of running Naive Bayes becomes low. However, as what you mentioned above, it is often criticised for its oversimplified assumption.I think that Naive Bayes classifier is kind of introduction to machine learning with easy coding. So we may apply Naive Bayes at first. After that, with the growth in knowledge of machine learning and coding, we may apply probabilistic classifier like Bayesian Network, Maximum Entropy. But of course, we need to know about our limitation before choosing a classifier. For an example, if the specification of the system is not strong in enough, running machine learning with iterative training time will be difficult. Then Naive Bayes will be more suitable at this moment."
2,41,20170321,6,"Hi Lanselott. Thanks for your sharing. I had written a more or less the same blog as you, talking about computer face difficulties in analysing Chinese sentences. As what you have mentioned, one Chinese sentence can have more than one meaning. But after reading my Stephen??s Blog, I know that there solutions to tackle it.That is list out the probability of each word that can link with other each word to form a node. Then one sentence is split by several nodes. Then each node connect other nodes to form different links. Finally, each link represent a different meaning. After applying a scoring function, the link with the highest score will be chosen, and the meaning of that sentences will be the meaning of that link.And then I think the point is the training data set about the scoring function. The training data set needed to be large. Furthermore, after training with a large data set, the program keeps updating its scoring function by mining the data in the Internet time to time. However, it may be more complicated, and more cost-expensive.That??s I think so far. And the below link is Stephen??s Blog, you may visit it to see about NLP in Chinese sentence, It is quite interesting https://fxxxmylife.wordpress.com/2017/02/24/automatic-segmentation-and-tagging-of-chinese-sentences-using-a-hybrid-algorithm"
48,41,20170321,6,"Hi Kelwin. Thanks for your sharing. I agree that people should think carefully before submitting and posting our personal data in social media network. When I first get touch in Facebook in my Secondary School, I submit sensitive personal data like date of birth, phone number. At that time, I have no concepts that these actions are exposing my personal data to public. On the other hand, I think that my friend in Facebook can contact me via the above information.Not long after that, there was a news about Octopus sold personal data of customers for interest. Then the company who get the sold personal data may have a cold call to you about selling their products. And then I started to receive many phone call about selling me to have insurances, loan, buy skin-care products, etc. I felt annoying about it. I realised that personal data should not be exposed on Internet, even we have locked the Information to be seen by our friend. That is because if one if our friend is compromised, then our personal data will be exposed also.I think that in Hong Kong, after the news I mentioned above. The awareness of handling personal data have been raised. The security sense of personal data is stronger. Therefore, I think the exposed of personal data in social media network is less likely to happened compared to the past."
14,41,20170321,6,"I agree that one of the limitation of contextual computing is difficult to collect personal data. Users are aware of the personal information, and are afraid that their personal data will be used in other purposes than contextual computing, like the news happened in 2010, Octopus sold personal data of customers for interest.Therefore, in order to collect personal information such as GPS location more easily, the users must agree the applications to collect before launching it. Moreover, to give more confident to the users, I think that the ways of handling such privacy information should be listed in terms and condition. I think that success example like Map Application, users are required to give their locations in order to have navigation options.I think the most important factor for the users to give personal information in exchange for a context is the attractiveness of the context. Useful functions like navigating to an unknown places for drivers, estimation of bus arriving time, weather forecasting, etc. also require users to give out their personal information like location, previous action. As they are useful functions, users are more likely to give it out."
73,41,20170321,6,"Thanks for your sharing. I think it is a bit hard for me to understand. Although you have given a example that ??the camera is a bit expensive, but it is very clear"", I don??t know where do the ??shoot"" come from and I think that the ??clear"" refers to the camera position is very clear (e.g. the camera is good at taking astronomy photo), but not the ??image quality"". As you have mentioned that it is called hidden type of object, those adjectives describing objects are required to be deduced. I think that the deduction of object may go wrong somehow.On the other hand, I just learnt extracting evaluation object can be done by evaluation of adjectives words, besides counting the frequency. That really widens my horizon. Are there any more possible solutions to deduce the evaluation objects?"
3,41,20170321,6,"Amazing. I just learnt that the finger cross gesture can have insulting meaning. I think that the most frequently used body languages is our emotion. For example, we usually smile when we greet someone. We usually scream out loudly when we feel horrified. These body languages are almost understood by everyone in the world. Using these will not lead to some embarrassments.I agree to you that body languages may different in regions. But I think that since we may live in Hong Kong for a long time, we understand the meaning of body languages in Hong Kong. We will not misuse them. But if we go to a new place, we must learn the culture there including the meaning of body languages. For example, the action of touching the head in Thailand is regarded as impolite and rude. That is what we have to aware.The most important is that we have to respect, and learn other culture especially when we are going to a new place. Then the embarrassment due to different interpretation of body languages can be avoided."

For example, If we don??t know how people interact with information, it is hard for us to build a user-friendly software even if we have the best technical skills in the world."
35,20,20170319,6,"Thank you for your sharing. I agree with you that Sentiment classification is useful but have many limitation. In our lecture, we used emoji as a example. Computer can distinguish whether a emoji is positive or negative by considering the concavity of the mouth and eyes. However, in complex situation such as books, Computer can??t distinguish +/- just base on the word used in the book. There may be satire (?S??) in a book where computer can not distinguish."
77,20,20170319,6,Thank you for your sharing. This give me more extra information in AR technology and also the relation between AR and what we learn in lecture. AR and VR may be important technologies in the future and both of them need semantic information.
48,20,20170319,6,"Thank you for your sharing. Nowadays, people used to post their personal information on to social media webpage such as Facebook and Instagram. And the information will be sold to some company for extracting business opportunity. People should be aware of what they post on Internet"
69,20,20170319,6,"Thank you for your sharing. In my opinion, the obvious advantage of using Naive Bayes Test Classification is that it is a low cost method for classification. It is fast and cheap because it only base on a conditional Probability calculation. Base on its low cost property, I think it is acceptable for it lose accuracy."
3,20,20170319,6,"Thank you for your sharing. I agree you that large group of users?? information which are related to their behaviors or preference will make huge profit. When a company have such a information, it can give specific advertisement to specific group of people to increase the advertising effect. That??s why some website such as facebook and instagram have huge Market capitalization because they hold billions of people??s information!"
58,20,20170319,6,"Thank you for your sharing. You give a brief introduction of Human Information Interaction and I really agree you that HII is important for Engineering Student. When we study networking, what we do is aim to reduce the error of transferring information between computer. Why don??t we take HII to increase the effectiveness of transferring information to Human?"
62,20,20170319,6,"Thank you for your sharing. In your blog post, you discuss that how important is Human Information Interaction to IE student. I agree you that as an IE student, we use many time to study Machine-Machine Interaction to reduce communication error between computer. However, we missed that Human-Machine Interaction is important too in communication. We should study HII as an IE student."
38,20,20170319,6,Thank you for your sharing. Your blog post give a real example of how Human Information Interaction be used in daily life. It is nice to know how Netflix make good use of the user Information and recommend specific video to specific user. You also discuss the problems of Netflix??s recommendation system. It may help me when I build a webpage in the future.
40,20,20170319,6,"Thank you for you sharing. I agree your post that semantic information is an simple and important method to exchange information. For example, the gate number in airport which is a semantic information that we can see. What do you mean by semantic information that we can not see?"
28,20,20170319,6,"Thank you for your sharing. I don't really agree that this is a theory-oriented course. In my opinion, this course is practical for me because it contains group project part for us to make good use of what we learn. The course makes me know more about how human interact with machine. As a IE student, we learn many knowledge on Machine-Machine interaction. It is good for us to learn HII."
29,20,20170319,6,"Thank you for your sharing. At the end of your blog post, you encourage us to reconsider whether rely on internet is good. Everyone will agree that the Internet is convenient and make our life simpler. However, I agree you that we should be aware of lacking our privacy to public. People used to upload their information such as name and phone number to social network such as facebook. We should reconsider what should we post on internet and what we should not"
25,20,20170319,6,"Thank you for your sharing. Everyone on earth will agree that VR technology is useful. In your blog post, you give example on how VR technology benefit our life. For example, we can use VR for job training. VR games are hit nowadays and I think VR will be much more useful than nowadays as information technology become more advanced."
7,20,20170319,6,"Thank you for your sharing.Augmented Reality technology can make advantages in different kind of industries. For example, we can see that property industry started to use augmented reality technology to substitute the old method of visit demonstration Unit .This technology not only can attract people, but also help to raise the employment rate because it need more talented person to develop more aspect of usage about augmented reality."
1,20,20170319,6,"Thank you for sharing. I agree you that human information interaction is very useful especially for information engineering student. As a IE student, we put lot of time to learn machine-machine interaction. However, human-machine interaction is important too to reduce communication error. If we know more about how people interact with information. It will help us in building software / web in the future"
55,39,20170319,6,"Thanks for sharing. I agree with you that technology help a lot in learning nowadays. There are many online learning forums that allow people to ask questions and find resources. People can also study some University courses on the Internet such as Coursera. Just as you have said, we may be able to simulate the lecture room and ask questions to the lecturer by virtual face to face through the AR/VR technologies in the future. Therefore, technology can definitely convenience us to learn and improve our learning experience."
55,39,20170319,6,"Thanks for sharing. After reading your post and three comments by other classmates above, I think that machine cannot replace human. Although machines replaced human that helped us a lot in production industry, machines are still controlled by human. We need to send commands to make the machines work while machines cannot work by themselves as machines have no mindset and no thinking. Therefore, unless human can create a machine that have his own mind, can self-learning and thinking like human, I think human will definitely cannot be be replaced by machine."
48,39,20170319,6,"I agree that people should concern about the security and privacy of all their social platforms?? accounts to avoid companies by collecting their information for other purposes. People should set the highest security configuration and permissions in all their social platforms?? accounts. For example, only allow friends read your photos in Facebook. Besides, people should have the computer security mindset to be aware of the ??Social engineering"" to avoid their passwords or any more personal information stolen by others. For example, do not click malicious links in Facebook or remember to clear cookies and sessions after login. Therefore, I think the most important thing is to improve people computer security mindset. Again, thanks for your sharing to remind us to think about the security and privacy in social platform"
69,39,20170319,6,"Thanks for pointing out the importance of the UX design nowadays. It helps me a lot to understand we need UX design in our product and let me think about the UX design in my FYP project. I agree with you that having a good UX design will make the product become more user-friendly and attractive. For example, Uber should add a ""re-create order"" button that to let user to re-create the same order by just pressing one button. Having this small function can make the whole thing become more convenience. Therefore, designers or developers should think more about the UX design rather than just thinking functions."
76,39,20170320,6,"After reading your posts and classmates?? comments, I agree that online shopping definitely bring lots of advantages to us and I usually do online shopping too. Except the advantages that you guys have mentioned above, maybe I want to share about the disadvantages of online shopping:1)we need to verify that the products bought from online are legit or not.2)we need to wait for the shipping and there is always delay.3)Hard to get refund if there have any problems such as receiving an inferior product.4)Bother to return the items if having problems.5)malicious online shopping website that may steal credit card information.Therefore, I think we need to think above points before doing online shopping although online shopping is very convenience."
76,39,20170320,6,"After reading your post, I strongly agree that the recommendation system helps us a lot when doing searching in different kinds of websites such as Shopping, Dinning or Information research. The recommendation system is definitely convenience me lots of time to do searching in the Internet. And I have learnt the technology and algorithm used behind of the recommendation system (the difference between collaborative and context-based filtering). So, thanks for sharing the knowledge."
10,39,20170320,6,"Thanks for your sharing. I agree that digital environment will be the new trend in the Hong Kong. Except those online platforms for shopping or Q&A on Internet, as one classmate mentioned above, the mature of AR/VR technologies can help to make the digital environment to the reality. For example, we can make some courses such as cooking by using VR technology to simulate the real cooking situation or using AR to simulate the Face-to-Face online chat room. Therefore, I think the digital environment concept and AR/VR technology will definitely be a trend especially in Hong Kong, which the population density is very high."
13,39,20170320,6,"Thanks for your sharing. I think human Information Interaction should be important to engineering. It is because we can apply our technical skills with the human information interaction research result to implement somethings to improve people??s life. With technology, we can make information to be a product to help people just like the above example using iBeacon to help in special education. Maybe there will have some VR gears will be developed to help in special education also in the future. Therefore, Human Information Interaction is important to engineering field."
18,39,20170321,6,"After reading your posts, I agree that the development trend of new technology will become more human-like to make it more user-friendly. As one classmate's mentioned above, the development of VR/AR are showing how to simulate a digital character to the reality (AR) or how to put user in the digital environment (VR). Both of these are showing how to make the technology to become more human-like. Therefore, I believe that in one day, more powerful technologies, such as sending file one computer to another computer by using gesture or more powerful AI like ""Jarvis"" in Ironman will be created to improve our life."
50,39,20170321,6,"After reading your posts, I agree that digital environment can definitely help to improve the learning experience. Instead of creating questions platforms or learning mobile apps, the trend of VR/AR are showing that these technologies have potential to make the digital environment to reality. For example, the idea of simulating the lecture that user can attend the lecture by wearing VR glasses. Or the idea of simulating the Q&A session by using the AR technology. Therefore, digital environment can definitely help to improve the learning experience."
33,39,20170321,6,"After reading your posts, I agree that digital information helps to improve our life. As you mentioned, online shopping platforms are changed our way in shopping and it is very suitable in Hong Kong's situation that lack land source. Also, I think the trend of AR/VR technologies have a big development potential in Hong Kong because of lack of land source. For example, we can simulate some activities by using AR/VR technologies that will not have land source problem. Therefore, I agree that digital information and digital environment help to improve our life."
55,30,20170321,6,"It is a trend to apply technologies to the education. There is no doubt that the technology can enhance the learning experience of the students in the school. Moreover, you have mentioned that we can use cloud service to get the knowledge, in my opinion, I think the cloud will go a long way to be the most important tools in education. Teachers can use the cloud to set, collect and grade work online. Students will have instant access to grades, comments and work via a computer, smartphone or tablet.With the cloud, the world will be our classroom. E-learning will change teaching and learning. Students can learn from anywhere and teachers can teach from anywhere. It will be a chance for Hong Kong to build up an educational cloud at the beginning of the trend."
19,30,20170321,6,"Well, very funny to read your article. You give me a notice about the Internet is changing our usage and manner in language. In my opinion, one of the most impressed changing in using language is the instant chat application, such as WhatsApp. Also, using the instant chat app with emoji and voice record, we can freely chat with everybody any time and anywhere. On the other hand, this is a new platform to communicate with others. Our generations are already snubbing old school phone calls, and WhatsApp will make that even easier. With the combination of text and emojis, it is more efficient for us to express our thought to others instantly, which is easier than the traditional phone call."
18,30,20170321,6,"Well, the development of the digital device is becoming smaller and smaller. From the biggest screen of television to the smallest screen of smartwatch, they all provide us different ways to interact with other information through a screen. However, in my opinion, I think the barrier between human and the screen will be disappeared or become less and less impact during people try to interact with information. Recently, the development of VR and AR are showing how people interact with external information without a ""screen"". In VR technologies, we can only use a VR headset or even a digital glasses to see the information. If we want to send out our request, we can only use a hand stick or even our hands.Thank you for your sharing. In the future, I think the ways of human and information interaction will vary, but the same idea is that we all want that way becomes the most convenient one for human and information."
10,30,20170321,6,"It is true that we can find much information through the social media, no matter the information is rumors or a confirmed ""truth"". However, we have no method to prevent other people to publish their ideas to the social media. The fast and huge network of Internet can spread out one information all over the world in a moment.In my opinion, one of the wise ways to use the social media is that we should not base our confidence on social media. If we rely on social media to build up, we also give it power to break us down. Social media can mess with our mind, our emotions, and our confidence.While social media interaction is a fun way to connect with friends, reading too much into it and letting it dictate our mood gives it a power it doesn??t deserve. Enjoy social media as an ??extra?? in your life, but don??t base your confidence on it. Put our faith in things that are real and reliable so our emotions stay off the roller coaster."
75,30,20170321,6,"Machine learning is a powerful tool for data analytics. It can help us predict the trend or a probability of an event, such as weather forecasting.As you mention that Google??s Alpha Go is using the mechanism of machine learning, however, in my opinion, it is more about artificial intelligence (AI). I would agree that most AI applications nowadays are indeed using or will use ML soon. On the other hand, Deep Learning, which is itself a kind of Machine Learning is becoming more an more popular and successful at different use case. Finally, it is also true that (machine learning) ML currently represents the most promising path to strong AI. But, who knows? Both of them can contribute an efficient way for human to interact with information."
55,17,20170321,6,"Thank you for your sharing. It is a very interesting article. I think that machine cannot replace human in the future as we will use those machines to service human. Some people may think human is clever than machine so that they cannot replace us. However, after reading news, I think the knowledge or the wisdom of the machine will surpass human one day. It is argued that machine just depend on algorithm. Human created those algorithms. Thus, human is clever than a machine. However, due to two reasons, machine can surpass human in the future. 1. Big data analysis: In this century, Artificial Intelligence(AI) program will collect huge of information for data analysis. Take AlphaGo as an example, it collected a lot of data related to Go. Therefore, it can predict that which step would be the best choose and win the match. Finally, we knew that it won many well-known and professional Go players. 2. Emotion affects decision: Due to different emotions, human will make different decisions. Therefore, we cannot always make a best solution. However, machine does not have any emotion. It can always make a better solution. Lastly, I would like to share the following news to all of you as a reference.http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/science-38521803"
55,17,20170321,6,"Thank you for your sharing. I do agree that digital technology can help learning in this century. There are three advantages that digital technology brings us. They are convenience, interactive and interesting. First of all, as what you have said, teachers can share their lecture notes to students through cloud service. Students can get the notes regardless of time and place. It is very convenient to learn.Secondly, it brings us interactivity. Nowadays, there are a lot of online platforms. In there, there are many of experts to answer questions. We can also interact with teachers outside the classroom.Finally, learning is very interesting through VR. The following video shows how VR can apply in education: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXYzj6qwCCkWe can observe that students are very excited and easy to abstract concept such as 3D coordinates."
13,17,20170321,6,"Thank you for your sharing. Human information interaction is an interesting topic that we should learn. Due to HII research, we can create different kinds of user-friendly and innovative software. Tommy made a good example that we can use iBeacon to help students in special school. We can create an App to check their location in the school so that the teacher can find out the student. In addition, by using big data, we can do some accurate prediction. Take the following news as an example. http://technews.tw/2014/06/15/big-data%EF%BC%9A%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86%E9%86%AB%E7%99%82%E7%9A%84%E7%B5%82%E6%A5%B5%E6%AD%A6%E5%99%A8/In 2008, by using Big data, Google can accurately predict the situation of influenza epidemic around the world so that the government can appropriately allocate resource in medical aspect."
30,17,20170321,6,"It is very common to connect social media through smart phone. It can help us to collect huge of information. Base on collected information, we develop plan or different algorithms in order to fit people??s need. However, one coin has two sides. We cannot neglect the disadvantage that smart phone or social media brings us. One of examples is social loneliness. The function of social media is to connect people. However, even we stick with others, we still feel lonely. Studies revealed that social media makes us even more lonely. ??The reason we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind-the-scenes with everyone else??s highlight reel.?? Thus, we feel alone. Lastly, I would like to provide an article related to social loneliness to all of you as a reference. https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/06/social-media-even-lonely/"
54,26,20170320,6,"I agree to your point of view. Human information interaction allows us to exchange information in a more efficient manner that aids our learning and broadens our horizons. HII comes into our daily life often, in particular, social issues. Different parties with different interest will have different opinions regarding the same topic, so I think it is important to analyse the comments and the links between different parties."
33,26,20170320,6,You raised a valid point on the advantages of studying Human Information Interaction. I believe that since social networks are very common nowadays and so there is a necessity in analysing the relationships and content between different users. HII could allow us to understand the behaviour of different users and look at something with a different point of view. Big data should also be one of the topics which we as an Information Engineering student should study which compliments on what we have studied in this course. I hope you can make a solid contribution to the society through this course!
65,26,20170320,6,"Well explanation to the three different types of human information interaction. I agree to your point on how Human Information Interaction binds into our lives and how it is important to us. As an IE student, we often need to deal with the exchange of information and how to encode and decode data. HII allows us to analyse the social ties between different nodes and do content analysis on the different comments provided. I often think that Huamn information interaction only relate to how human interact with information but not between machine-machine interaction, good example raised!"
24,26,20170320,6,"I've read a lot of blog posts on how HII is important but I like the unique point that you've made. When we write programs, we often tend to create a efficient program and ignore the user-interface of the program at first. These visual information often seems to be insignificant but in fact is when we think carefully. HII allows us to understand user needs and also how different individuals will be affected by different information representation, thus being able to create a user-oriented program. After studying this course, we would be able to do more social analysis and understand user's behaviour."
17,26,20170320,6,"This is a very comprehensive post and you raised some good points on what makes social media a success. However, I think one of the most fundamental factor that leads to social media's success is the 'Herd Effect'. As we all know, social platforms like Facebook starts with only a few users, and then through recommendations and when people who does not using social media realises more and more people using social media, they will sign up for an account and thus boosting the number of social platform users, which I believe is the fundamental of the success of social media."
50,26,20170320,6,"Many people often think that the disadvantages of using social media outweighs the advantages of using social media, since there are many information on the web allowing us to surf 24/7. Of course, there are some 'useful' information and some that are 'invalid'. However, I think that the advantages outweighs the disadvantages and I believe that one of the vital advantage of using social media is many-to-many interactions where we could all share our thoughts easily and allow academic interactions to be done anywhere and anytime. Using social media as a tool for learning allow allows links to be created between different students who does not know each other, such as what I am doing now."
39,26,20170320,6,"Thank you for sharing a new concept of online information artifacts! I do agree to what you say that social media helps the creation and spread of it. In this information era, we are exposed to a huge a,punt of information everyday and many of us contribute in sharing information to the rest of the world online. Since new information is created everyday, the 'Share' button on websites become one of the most convenient way for us to share the information that we've read and allow different users to view the information available. This helps spread the information easily. Some users might be inspired by a certain piece of information and create their own online information artifacts, thus social media helps the creation and spread of it."
12,26,20170320,6,"I agree that the development of social media affects the way we deal with information. Back in 10-15 years ago, social media are not that common and people used to receive information from TV, radio or prints, and we used to interact with others through traditional communication channels such as telephone. As we step into the digital era, social media becomes popular and become a disruptive innovation in how we exchange information. Social media enables us to share a piece of information to multiple users at the same time. This increases the rate of information flow, and social media acts as a platform for users to share their opinions, ultimately achieving two-way communication."
63,26,20170320,6,"I agree that semantic information is important when we are analysing data because different words would have a different implied meaning. What differentiates humans and computers are that the language computer use is straight forward with a very direct meaning since it is basically commands. However, language that human beings use would have different implied meanings, and even if we combine two distinct words, it might have a different meaning as its original meaning. For example, ""the pen is mightier than the sword"" has no relationship with 'pen' and 'sword', but it implies a meaning behind the phrase that convincing people with words are more effecting than forcing them to do. This might not be analysed this way by computers. There is still a long way for content analysis to be accurate."
33,26,20170320,6,"VR is an interesting technology that simulates events and creates ""Virtual physical information"", in which the two terms contradicts to each other. I think the idea of VR is to make good use of the physical information that we've already received and create another 'copy' of the information. This sometimes could be interesting because it is how physical information and artificial physical information binding together to let us simulate different situations. To a certain extent, I think that VR does has its value, since it could allow us tosimulate some dangerous activities without ourselves being hurt, which is also a limitation of only interacting with physical information that actually exists."
74,26,20170320,6,"It is good that you have mentioned about 2 main categories of filtering in recommender systems, but actually there is a third type of filtering called hybrid filtering, which is the combination of collaborative and content-based filtering. Since both filtering methods has its own pros and cons when creating recommendations, hybrid-filtering allows the pros of both filtering methods to be implemented into the design of the filtering system. Actually more and more recommender systems are using this approach in order to provide more accurate predictions of user behaviour. However, I do agree that privacy would be a main concern of these recommender systems since lots of user data will be collected and analysed, which might create privacy issues."
50,26,20170320,6,"You raised some good points and I agree that Sentiment Analysis is very common nowadays on social media. Often our word choice contributes to atmosphere of a phrase and some 'strong' words highlights the overall mood of an opinion. This is particularly important when we are considering sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis can allow us to understand the overall 'trend' of the opinions on a certain issue, which is important to note when we are analysing the contents and drawing conclusions from the opinions.There is still quite a long way to go for sentiment analysis to be at least 90% accurate since there are too much proverbs and negated meanings."
63,26,20170320,6,"Machine learning is a hot trend nowadays and it involves a complicated set of algorithm to analyse the digital information collected from its ??learning"" process. I agree that human cognition is different than that of computer??s cognition, so sometimes it is difficult for computers to have a ??human mindset?? and think the way that humans think. One major difference is that humans?? decisions are easily affected by emotions and thus makes ??rational?? decisions, but computers does not consider human emotions when making decisions, which is what differentiates the way humans and computers process information. To a certain degree, machine learning can make our life??s easier but I don??t not think that machines could completely simulate human decisions, and thus cannot replace humans."
54,26,20170320,6,"You have provided a balanced view on the benefits and drawbacks of contextual computing. It is often difficult to analyse data on the same issue but from different sources and being able to differentiate which source is the most reliable. With human??s interaction with information, the same piece of information might be interpreted differently. There are 4 main types of data collected for contextual computing, they are social, interest, behaviour and individual. But the four types of data collected all leads to privacy problems. By law, I think the use of contextual computing still needs to be monitored. Inevitably, contextual computing will become a trend in a few years time, but the privacy issues still have to be solved."
33,26,20170321,6,"I agree that the existence of digital environment makes our life easier and more efficient. For example, online shops are digital environments that represents a physical item digitally available for customers to choose from. In shops, the item itself does not recommend you with similar items, instead you have to ask the shopkeeper or look for it by yourself. However, the digital environment enables us to analyse a product and make suggestions on similar product with a larger scale, since the amount of items available are much more than that a shop can display. A lot of overhead costs can be saved for the shop owner. On top of that, data on user??s preference can also be saved for future marketing use, which makes the shopping experience more desirable. Digital information seems meaningless itself as it is only 1s and 0s, but the uses of it are far more than that we imagine."
4,47,20170321,6,"There is no doubt that Computer-Supported Cooperative Work have many advantages. For instance, it allows members of the teams that work asynchronously to reply at any time and any place, hence every member can catch up the working schedules. Moreover, it increases group participation with more team members because people share their idea through text-based CSCW communication, like email and communication app, that keep the record of communication, thus members can read it and discuss base on it. However, there are some challenges in CSCW. For example, team members may work relying on different journals and research, disagreement and confusion will occur if some terms are used in different ways during they work. Therefore, we should be careful to avoid this situation and reach the consensus when we work as a team."
26,54,20170321,6,"I agree to your point. Content analysis is around us and making a great help to us. Besides, I think that there are challenges that content analysis or the use of big data have to face. The problem of users?? privacy is one of it. Data has to be collected for data analysis and data collection requires users?? consent. It is more difficult to collect data since people are more aware of the leakage of personal data. Therefore, earning users?? trust is the upcoming challenge of developing this technology."
26,54,20170321,6,"I agree to your point. It is true to say that people use social media network because of the social trend. More and more, I have seen that people also become a sheep in the herd when they use the social media network. For instance, when people see others keep posting a photo of certain place, they will also go there to ??check in?? and post the same photo. Another example is the ice bucket challenge. Many people neglect the reason behind this challenge and just to play and share on their own site. It shows that many people do not really think before they act, which is not a good sign. Therefore, I think that sometime it??s ok to follow the social trend but we need to have critical thinking."
47,54,20170321,6,"iBeacon is a good example that help humans interaction. Nowadays, there are so many new technologies that enhance exchange of human information. It proves the development of technology is becoming more mature. However, there are challenges that developer has to tackle. It is difficult to promote an application and make it common among people. Sometime even the application is power, it may not really give direct help to people??s need, like google glass. Hence, I think that developer should think more on how to design their product in stead of only focusing on the functionality."
32,33,20170320,6,"1.???? example about MC Donald has shown how sentimental analysis benefit to the company and the customers, I really agree with you at that point. However I think sentiment analysis has benefited us not only commercially but also in various industries. For example, in politically, sentiment analysis can help a pilot to consider more opinions of the citizens and make the right decision. Nowadays many pilots in different countries like to study their Facebook comments to know more about people from different class. It is really good to make our country and society better. There are still millions of examples in different industries, they all showed sentiment analysis is the trend."
32,33,20170321,6,"I really agree your words that songs and music are the ??apps?? of earlier era. That??s really a interesting point. As our course is about human information interruption, music and song are really a special kind of information in social media. When you listen to a touching melody or lyric. This a kind of one way interruption from the musician to you. A great musician like Jay chow, his productions have become a kind of the culture to let other countries know more about our country. We can also say he has made great contribution to the human information interruption. After the computer technology develop rapidly, I think this has made the music industry stronger. As we can see nowadays, personal live telecast is very popular in network platform, we can usually see some people use Facebook live to sing in front of thousands of people. The audience can give like or comments to the singer, the social media has built up a bridge between the singers and audiences which is a great progress. This is a special and interesting information interruption between human being."
32,33,20170321,6,"Thank you for sharing me about the history of computer that was really something I have never heard about. I have not realized that computer had been aiding human mankind??s in daily works such a long time. It has been proved that, computer technology is being developed rapidly. And I also agree that AI technology is becoming more and more mature, as we can see some news about it that in some chess and board game, the AI has won over some world-famous players. We really need to consider about the over-developing of AI, we should make sure both the AI could make our lives more comfortable and under our control."
23,3,20170315,6,"I agreed with you that physical information is more trustworthy. After reading your blog, I found that physical information is very interesting. Therefore, I searched for how different motions represent different meanings and here are some examples. When somebody is rubbing his eyes, it could mean that he/she does not want to see something. Or when someone is touching his/her cuff, he/she may probably be calming down his/her agitation."
76,3,20170319,6,"I agreed that online shopping has so many advantages, not only for the customers but also for the sellers. First, owning an online shop is much easier than owning a shop in the real world because the businessmen need not pay the rent, it can reduce their operation expenses. Also, online shops open 24 hours. Therefore the customers can visit their store no matter what time it is. Better still, online shops can be reached by everyone all over the world, so as to widen the range of customers. I believe that these are also the reasons why online shops become more popular."
39,3,20170320,6,"Thank you for your sharing. I agree that whether the UX design of an application is good or not can determine the popularity of this app. After reading your blog, I felt interested in what is a ""proper"" UX design. So I have done some google search and found out one of the criteria that a proper UX design should have, that is not asking users for too much information. Asking the users for too much information will make the users feel annoying and worry about whether their personal data will be misused or not. It will drive the user away. Therefore, in order to provide a good user experience for the users, we should only collect enough information from them."
73,3,20170320,6,"Thank you for your sharing. I agreed that opinion mining is really useful for the companies to analysis whether the customers satisfy with their products or not. The example that you have given (i.e. Taobao) is one of the significant examples, which can show how a company utilizes the opinion mining to classify the product. I have got another example, that is the Agoda. It is a website which introduces the hotels for the travelers. It collects the reviews from the customers and tries to classify the review into different categories. So as to suggest the best hotel to the users."
6,3,20170321,6,"This is the funniest blog that I have read. The examples that you have given showed how interesting that language can be, especially for the Chinese language. It also reminded me of a typical example,""????????????????????"". Different combinations of words can have different meanings. Therefore, I think the news media should concern about this problem. When they are reporting a serious issue, they should mind the wordings that they are using. Otherwise, it may lead to some embarrassing situation. Also, it may be shown no respect to the people who are involved in that issue."
55,50,20170321,6,"Thank you for sharing. We share similar views and I do agree that the digital world has helped improve our learning experience in many ways.For example, we can learn freely in the Internet such as YouTube and Wikipedia. This has greatly encouraged self-learning. However, we have to be careful since publishing is as easy as assessing. The information we obtained from the Internet may not be all reliable. Therefore, we should do more research on the topic to learn thoroughly. Besides, while some say that the Internet poses risk to distract children??s learning, I think it also provides a more interesting way of learning. For example, there are games developed to help children learn mathematics in a more vivid and fun way. Finally, the digital world helped to share information within a group, so that we can discuss and respond more freely, which gives a deeper understanding in the learning process.I have also posted a blog about education in digital world.

55,50,20170321,6,"Thank you for your sharing. This is a very interesting question. Machines have served a great extent in these years and we can foresee that they will be involved even more in the future. Will machine surpass human in the future?Some say machine does not have emotions like humans, and they cannot make decisions in a considerate way like humans do. However, it also gives an advantage that the decision machines make can be completely rational. Some say that machines cannot make prediction. However, big data analysis has been raised in this century. It is useful to predict future trend by analyzing the data in hands. In my opinion, humans do invent machines. However, we should not depend on it too much that we loose our ability to control it. We should be aware of this so that we can use machine to make our lives more convenient but at the same time not allowing it to surpass us."
4,72,20170315,6,"Your blog post inspired me about the issue of privacy problem raised by Contextual Computing! As the system has lots of the data of the users, it has a risk of exposing the information to the public without our explicit permission. If hackers hack in the server of such database, there are millions of users information would be exposed. On 22th June, 2013, PCworld news reported that Facebook exposed 6 million users?? contact Information due to the bug of security. Although contextual computing is widely used, we should think about whether we are too relying on it."
4,72,20170316,6,"Satisficing can meet the needs of the users efficiently. One of the example you have mentioned, UX design (User experience design) which can enhance the users?? satisfaction in the aspects of interaction, usability and accessibility. For achieving satisficing in UX design, designers normally focus on the costs and benfits. First, the interaction cost should be as low as possible. If it is a website, it should be easy to read and acquire information. It means that the usability is high and accessibility of the product can be improved. Second, higher benefits of the product can provide useful information and maximize the outcome after users read it. Hoping that the strategies I suggested are useful for you!"
4,72,20170318,6,"Apart from the language specific limitations that you have mentioned, the other limitations are technological limitation and data specific limitation.For technological limitation, using sentiment analysis cannot analysis the root cause of their arguments or opinions. Besides, we categorize the article with 3 groups, such as ??good"", ??neutral"" and ??bad"". In fact, the article maybe not exactly belongs to one of these groups but we just treat it in this way.For data specific limitation, sentiment analysis cannot apply to all the types of data. Images, videos or voice messages should be excluded during using sentiment analysis. However, social network always contains lots of the multimedia content, sentiment analysis cannot have an accurate analysis without analyzing them."
47,72,20170318,6,"Right! Helping us to design a user-friendly information system is one of the benefits. For my opinion, focusing on the human relationship with information and being a multidisciplinary field are the benefits too.Most of the information analysis concentrated on the technique skills or data rather than the root reason. Human Information Interactions is investigating how human interact with information which is more effective.On other hand, Human Information Interactions is a multidisciplinary field which means it can use it for different aspects including psychology, sociology machine learning, information science, marketing and engineering. Therefore, you can have further research and study when we use HII. That??s why HII is a big topic many courses!"
47,72,20170318,6,"Although iBeacon enhances the exchange of human information, there are some limitations of using it.iBeacon only can implement simple operations. Using the same example in the blog post, making order via the application in coffee shop. If the clients want to have to have a tall size of espresso with skinned mike, cream on it, 50 % sugar and having rusty latte art. Of course, it is impossible to let them choose for every step. Therefore, it is hard to fit the users who have special needs.Besides, iBeacon lacks of precision as there are too many factors affecting the strength of the signal. As a result, the performance of it is not stable."
47,72,20170319,6,"According to the property of ??predicting the next item in such a sequence in the form of a (n 1)?Corder Markov model?? that you have mentioned, n -gram can be used in different fields. Unigram is referring to size 1 N-garm, bigram is referring to size 2 N-garm?? and so on.When we want to check used how many times of ??tired?? in an article. We can just use a unigarm with the word ??tired??. If we want to check the opposite meaning of the word which is in unigram, such as ??not tired??. Then, we can use a bigram with the words ??not tired??. Finally, when we check whether the article have plagiarized or not, we can use the n-gram with the size of the specific of the sentence or paragraph. Therefore N-gram contributed lots in Natural language processing."
47,72,20170321,6,"Just like what you have said, machine learning and big data are closely related. Without the limitations of human, machine learning can make use of the internet resources and data to analysis.With the size of the data is bigger, the machine learning can learn more and have an advanced and improved analysis. Except the learning method u suggested, supervised learning and unsupervised learning, there are semi-supervised and reinforcement learning. Using these methods, machine learning can overcome the constrains of complexity and variability."
14,48,20170320,6,"I agree with you that information, which provided by the authority, is one of the important factor that affect people thinking. Also, Internet and social media have become popular in this few year, I think these two new tools will affect people easily. Social media increase the mobility and the way to delivery the information. Therefore, i think we should pay more attention while we using the social media in our daily life. Otherwise, our critical and personal thinking will become the same to the others."
14,48,20170320,6,"In my opinion, I think contextual computing have become popular in this few year. For example, most of the modern television have the function to predict what the users would like to watch. Also, most of the social media application, such as Facebook, will collect our preference data in order to provide some specific advertisement to us. I think contextual computing can facilitate our daily life, but it may also cause lots of privacy and personal security problem to us."
41,48,20170320,6,"I think social networking have become very popular in this few years. One of the main reason is that social networking platform provide an easy and convenient way for users to interact with their peers and family members. On the other hand, people also can easily get lots of information from the social networking platform. However, I recently have read a blog, which topic is mainly focus on how social networking platform affecting our mind and thinking. Therefore, we have to pay more attention when we using the social networking platform."

I think this course provide a way for us to know more about how does people communicate with computer. Also, social media and information is very important in nowadays. It is because the modern technology is now just the practical programming skill but also some application and high-level skill, such as Big Data. Therefore, let us spend more time and afford in this course and let us encourage each other while we are studying."
20,48,20170320,6,"I think the rating skill is useful for us when we need to predict the number of users. Also, I agree that this course provide lots of interest and useful skill. For example, I remember professor have taught us use the dot product and vector to calculate the vector space model and cosine similarity. These basic mathematical skill, which have taught in year 1 fundamental math course, is very easy, but it can be very useful in this course and future day. These kind of simulation and tools can help us to predict the trend and the expectation when we are build new website or system."
77,48,20170320,6,"I think information is important in our daily life. In this course, professor have taught lots of theory and the concept of ""entropy"" is quite important and it is the fundamental of most of the theory. However, I think this blog is too short and lack of personal viewing and feeling. Hope you may accept my suggestions"
22,48,20170321,6,"I agree that HII can help improving current information systems and services. For example, AI (Artificial Intelligence) is very popular in lots of fields. HII act an very important role when the expert developing AI. I remember Google have invent an AI call AlphaGo, which have a competition with human in last year. The result show that AI are ""smarter"" than human. It also shows that HII can improve our quality of life."

It reduce the process time and facilitate most of the users. Therefore, I think human information interaction and AI will become the new trend of our modern world. I hope you found this comment interesting."
33,48,20170321,6,"I think VR can change our lifestyle and daily activities. VR provide a way to simplify the complex problems into a easier situation. For examples, The training of pilot can be easier because the trainee only need a VR system and it can provide a highly similarity flight simulation. Also, I think VR system can increase the quality and mobility of video conferencing in our daily life. It can give the users a better way to communicate with the others.However, there are also some drawbacks when we using VR. For examples, users may addicted into the VR environments . Some of them even preferring the virtual world than the real world. Therefore, we should pay more attention when we use the VR."
27,48,20170321,6,"I agree with you that we can see recommendation in social media as a reference and we should not trust them directly. As professor have taught the concept of human information interaction(HII), most of the social media website will collect our personal information, such as what kind of pages that we have liked. After collecting the data, they will provide these kind of advertisement and information to us in order to get our attention. Therefore, I think we have to be aware when we use the social media."
72,4,20170319,6,"Yes, I am quite sure that chameleon effect is mostly the way poeple go when it comes to dealing with anything in their daily life. It just likes a trend to which people are following. For example, more and more people are currently appreciating Korean's fashion,music,dancing,food and etc. not always because people themselves think its style is good and surpasses other countries, but because they follow the trend. That's what we can see, Social cognition. Owing to other's views, you are gradually changing your taste. I share your opinion that we should reflect ourselves and think about the information we receive are trustworthy or not, as the way we mirror other people may somehow be not unfavorable."
74,4,20170319,6,"As you said, there are undoubtedly a big difference between the digital world and reality that we need to convert digital things into something understandable to us in order to make a connection with the digital world, thus intellectually making our life better. For example, in programming world, be it C++ or Java, we try to build up something in computers and what we need is to convert our idea into something computer can understand. An example is like Changing ??If I have $20, I will buy an apple?? to ?? If(money ==20) return obj apple;??Communicating with or using the internet well is surely the cornerstone to the construction of intellectual world."

It is rather hard to convince everyone to possess a recommendation system at the expense of their privacy. After experiencing some websites like Rakuten, Taobao, the recommendation system will keep giving you the related website or advertising, even if you are using other websites. Actually, the system knows your preference, and this may pose a danger that some companies will target you as their potential customers and keep promoting you their porducts. This is surely a matter of bothering."

For example, sometimes we try to learn something by just reading some textbook (one-to-many), while we cannot understand all the details in a short period. Therefore, we can make use of the discussion board to discuss with other people to figure out your difficulties. Eventually, if we still have some misunderstanding, we can just simply ask our teacher/ professor by sending an email. This three processes are actually the way we learn new things. In fact, social media is undoubtedly our cornerstone to study."
56,12,20170321,6,"That's true. From the point of consumers, not only they can interact with other users, but also they can seek help from the company directly. It provides a convenient way for them to ask questions instead of browsing the company website and check how to contact the company.Besides, Facebook can be beneficial as well. With more and more pages established, Facebook can easily obtain users' preference and recommend some related pages to users. As a result, the income of advertisement will keep rising."

For example, the law of conservation of energy. Energy cannot be generated out of thin air and it also cannot disappear. However, the information will disappear with time because the information is stored in the book or memory.The book will wear and tear. The memory will lose. I am very sorry but I disagree with you.I think the reason for this argument is that the formula of information entropy is very close to the entropy of the second law of thermodynamics. however, it should not be the reason because they have total different property in our real world."
13,57,20170320,6,"This blog post gave us an overall picture of the chronological order of development for three types of information and their relationships. Underneath such development lies the progress of human civilization. When our ancestors communicated with physical information, they could only convey limited meaning and thus perform limited cooperation. The invention of writing and languages symbolized a significant leap on civilization. Because humans are able to convey a lot more complicated meanings and build social institution using semantic information. And in the current era, we start to involve not only more humans but also more ??machines?? into our lives. So digital information is the bridge connecting the enlarging human society as well as the digital society consisting of ubiquitous smart devices. One enlightening view given by the author is that, the occurrence of new forms of information is NOT the replacement for the older form, but rather an enlargement for them. Languages can help us describe physical information better and break the walls of physical information to spread the information in a wider range. Digital information can enhance the access to almost any piece of semantic information available in the world. Maybe in the future there will be other types of information that can bring us to an era that we??ve never expected. Let??s get prepared and see where the technology could lead us to : )."
19,57,20170320,6,"I??ve read your reference [2] about the point of ??bit data is too big??. And I personally don??t agree with the point for the following reasons. The main arguments used in [2] to support the conclusion that ??Big data has no role in digital marketing?? are :1) There is no data when the business need it.2) Preprocessing data takes too long time.3) The big data projects are usually slow. My idea is that, these arguments are like complaining for the imperfections of status quo. These imperfections will improve over time. And in the long run, big data is still the trend that a prospective business should not miss. Why could I say so? Because technology is always moving forward. It has never stopped for even one second. As mentioned in your blog, we are generating more and more amount of content (UGC) and they can be perfect source for data. Indeed collecting them and processing them takes some time, but we are inventing more powerful technology to help us collect all there piece of valuable information. As for the speed of big data projects, I think the main bottle neck are the parallel algorithms as well as the infrastructure. With the spread of cloud computing, we can actually enjoy big data service in a much lower cost using the infrastructure on the cloud. For example, Amazon AWS provides ready-to-use suite for big data projects that can help small enterprises analyze their data better. Moreover, researchers are developing more powerful parallel algorithms and infrastructures that can even speed up the current performance of big data projects. In summary, everything is moving forward. Maybe the performance of big data is not at the perfect speed and ROI, it is still the valuable trend that the business should not give up."
69,57,20170320,6,"I totally agree with what you posted about UX design. In fact, UX designer has been my dream job for a long time. I??m now taking courses in Human-Computer Interaction (SEEM3510) and learnt several useful techniques in designing interface with high usability. If you are interested you can have a look at my blog post with the following link : https://ierg3320jinny.wordpress.com/2017/03/10/guidelines-and-principles-for-designing-user-interfaces-with-high-usability/There are quite a lot of examples for good/bad UI/UX design. And here I would like to comment about how we could measure or evaluate one design. There are five human factors that could help us quantify the quality of a design:1) Easy to learnA good UI should give clear and consistent instruction so that the users can learn to use it very quickly. In the amazon case given by you, the buttons are arranged in a clear manner so the user know how to perform an action like buying a product at the first glance.2) Easy to memorizeA good product doesn??t have a lot of command for the user to remember. For example in iOS or MAC OS, most of the operations can be done by fingers. And the gestures such as squeezing with two fingers usually carry semantic meanings that could help the user to memorize its function.3) Low error rateA good design will prevent the occurrence of error. For example, www.airbnb.com will gray out the unavailable date in the calendar when the users are selecting their check-in and check-out time.4) Subjective SatisfactionA good design should gain enough subjective satisfaction from the user.5) Easy to use A good product should have high efficiency in performing the targeted task. The best interface is no interface. The users can get fully control of what is going on and there should be no gulf of execution."
11,57,20170320,6,"Thank you for sharing this practical solution to the social media recommender system. Indeed the real bottleneck for the big data problems is to parallelize both the infrastructure and the algorithms. I was pretty impressed by how we generate pairs of users that follow the same person in the social network and add them up together to calculate similarities between them. This idea can break a big and memory expensive problem into a parallel problem that can be run separately on commercial machines. Hadoop is a popular ecosystem for solving big data problems. Your description about Hadoop has strengthened my understanding towards it and the related software. Now that you have showed the algorithm and infrastructure needed to implement a social network recommendation system, maybe you could also provide some ideas for configuring our own Hadoop clusters using Amazon Web Services. Because I know that with our CUHK email we can register an education account to enjoy 100 USD coupons from Amazon.

2,57,20170320,6,"Natural language is indeed very complex in nature. So my opinion will be , instead of breaking down the structure of natural language and try to establish rules to fit the machines, we can let the machines learn natural language using human??s mindset. This somehow leads to the state-of-the-art NLP solutions: neural networks. The idea of neural network originated from the organization of human brains, where there are neurons connected with each other by axons. In artificial neural networks, computational models are built up to simulate how human brain works. There are many types of artificial neural network according to their structure. For the machine translation problem that maps a sentence in one language to another language, recurrent neural network (RNN) can reach the optimal performance. Each node or neuron in RNN will takes the output of the last step as the input in the current step, so the structural information in a sentence can be preserved. What we need to do is to feed the neural network with enough data, and design it with proper number of layers and neurons. If you are interested you can search more about the mechanism of RNN online. Moreover, if we combine different types of neural networks, we can even translate ??image?? to ??sentence??, which is a similar process to machine translation despite that the source language is encoded in visual format. However, the disadvantage of using neural networks as the solutions to NLP problems is that, we as the programmers actually do not know what is going on inside the network. The performance purely rely on the training data as well as the structure of the network (which is not directly related to the problem itself). But anyway this is a possible way to dissolve the difficulties mentioned in your blog post. Hope my comments can give you some idea about how NLP could move forward. : )"

When the data is not enough, it also can solve classify problem.Disadvantage: classifier??s result maybe not well, because the assumption of the feature independence may sacrifice the accuracy.How to choose the classifier is depends on many aspects, the training set size, different algorithms?? advantages,database??.it??s complicated.

Nowadays, some companies have already developed the embryo of the sentiment analysis and opinion mining. Take the shopping website Taobao as an instance, when you browse reviews of a product, the system can extract some key words from thousands of comments, then if you can know features of the product from key words intuitively. Furthermore, input system is also a good example of opinion mining, based on your past input habit, the system can put those words you use more frequently in priority. However, those tecnologies can only do some simple extraction and recommendation. In order to make the computer understand and even predict our opinion, there is still a long way to go."

For example, slangswith the same meaning may have different form in different languages. According to a bookcalled Out of Control from Kevin Kelly, I think it may be improved by big data technology.Specifically, analyses of information could be more and more accurate if we use hugeamount of data to train it. For example, researchers use a huge dataset to test GoogleTranslate and make some adjustment and correction after every single test. In this testingprocess, Google Translate could do self-leaning, and become more and more accurate.I think the problem of traditional NLP could be improved with big data technology.Moreover, I believe that the combination of NLP and big data could become the nextopportunity for most fields."

Firstly, technology could cause loss of low-skilled jobs,such as cleaner, seller, typist, etc. However, it may not cause huge negative impact on highskilledjobs, such as engineer, actors, artists, etc. Secondly, new tech may cause short-termunemployment; but it would not cause long-run unemployment. Because once employersneed less low-skilled stuff which is replaced with machine, they must require more stuff tohandle/operate/maintain the machine. In total, the number of positions in the market wouldnot decrease, although the distribution of positions changes.Every whole new generation brings fears of the past, requiring to put old things to rest. It isimpossible to prevent this change. The only thing we can do is to conform to this trend."
13,38,20170322,7,"Thanks for helping us review these 3 kinds of information- physical, semantic, and digital!Just as you mentioned, digital information carries not only digital meaning, but alsosemantic explanation and physical experience. This really inspires me. I wonder that couldwe associate digital information to semantic information and physical information, such asrehabilitation training for disabled people.As we know, Professor Chan joins a program which aims to help deaf and mute people learnlanguage. It??s something like an app, with which disabled people can learn vocabulary andgrammar. For example, when they are leaning a sentence- I like eating apples, his/her selfie,the like button on facebook, and a photo of apples will be shown in order. In this case, deafand mute people could learn language with physical pictures in a digital way.Such apps help disabled really a lot. Hope there could be more and more such helpfulcreations."
58,38,20170322,7,"Thanks for your sharing about k-clustering! However, I want to add something, which mayhelp your understanding about clustering be more comprehensive.In the class, Prof. Chan introduced that clustering can be divided into 2 main categorieshardand soft. ??Hard?? means every data can only belong to one cluster; ??Soft?? means everydata can belong to different clusters. We learnt k-clustering which is a branch of hardclustering; however, we didn't study soft clustering in class. In order to get a morecomprehensive understanding of clustering, I strongly suggest you to take a look on softclustering.The following linkage is an article about soft clustering that I wrote. Hope it would help.Address: https://wordpress.com/posts/iecuhkeduhk1155062181.wordpress.com"
58,38,20170322,7,"Thanks for your sharing about these online recommendation system, such as DianPing App,recommendation systems of Amazon and Netflix, ??Friends you may know?? of Facebook,etc.Because I am interesting in this topic as well, I would like to share a real case about onlinerecommendation system with you.Netflix recommendation system use 2 main cycles to achieve such recommendationanalyses. In the first cycle, Firstly, they need to generate hypotheses of the user??s preferencevia a matrix; secondly, they train the model with user??s historical data and correct worryvalues in the matrix; lastly, they update matrix??s values and evaluate the model. In thesecond circle, they first use the new algorithm to generate recommendations for users; if thethis recommendation succeeds, they use this algorithm for recommendation; however, if therecommendation fails, they need to go back to the first circle and make a new algorithm.Hope this case about Netflix could help."
57,38,20170323,7,"Thanks for your sharing about models of information!You mentioned that the first model is kind of static; and the second one is more dynamicand flexible. Compared to the first one, the second one illustrates that different layers ofinformation are not mutually exclusive; however, they can evolve together with each otherin some situations.I totally agree with you. In my opinion, it??s impossible for us human to get only one layer ofinformation at one time. For example, when we have some perception/ cognation of adepression experience and tell it to our friends, we are in the layer of both perception andspoken language; during the speaking of such depressed experience, we may recall ourrelated depressed feeling, which belongs to our perception/cognation. In this situation, thereare dynamic interaction between perception/ cognation and spoken language.Hope my understanding would help."
57,38,20170323,7,"Thanks for your sharing about semantic information.I totally agree with you that semantic information plays an really essential part ofcivilisation.Associating with the three layers of information- physical, semantic, and digital, physicalinformation and semantic information often have tightly interaction with each other. Forexample, we see some physical objects; and we transfer this physical information intosemantic information (i.e. language). Actually, different culture/origins has really differentunderstanding/ perception towards the same physical object. For instance, colour red ismore of festiveness for Chinese, but it??s more of bloodiness/ violence for English. From thisperspective, if we want to transfer the same physical information into different languages,the perception/ cognation we use may be different, which means that people having differentdominant languages may have different perception/ cognation.From this point of view, the same semantic information plays different roles in differentcivilisations."
11,38,20170323,7,"Thanks for you sharing about smart city plan in HangZhou, China!Actually, smart city program is popular in HK as well. Just as the lecturer Prof. Chan invitedto our class in week nine, there are thousands of experts contributing to this field in HK.I want to share something that the lecturer told us with you. He mentioned that they alsowork in financial security field, which mainly focuses on anti-hacker and security system ofbanks. There are 2 training teams in their cyber security department- hacker team and antihackerteam. Using a real dataset, hacker team demo to attack banks and users; and antihackerteam demo to offend from these attacks. Through such exercise, they improve theirability in financial security field.Hope this real case could give you some inspiration."
11,38,20170323,7,"Thanks for your sharing about your understanding of human information interaction (i.e.HII).You illustrated 4 main reasons why HII is important for engineering students. I reallyappreciate your understandings. Moreover, I want to add something important but youdidn??t mentioned.Personally I think HII could break the obstacle between us technical guys and un-technicalpeople. Without HII, people who are not familiar with programming language couldn??t havechance to operate machines or communicate directly with computers; with HII, such untechnicalpeople can handle complex machines and deal with digital information easily. Usinformation engineers bridge the gap between un-technical people and complex technology.Hope my idea could give you some inspirations."
78,38,20170323,7,"Thanks for sharing your understanding about relationship between NLP and computerscience!You mentioned that computers translate programming code into machine code(i.e. 0 and 1);similarly, NLP helps human to translate human language into the language that machinescan easily understand.I totally agreed with you. Moreover, I want to add something about the problems of NLPtechnology. Actually, natural language understanding and natural language generation are 2main problems in NLP field. For example, it??s difficult for machine to accurately understandslangs, and generate complex paragraphs in proper grammars and structures.Hope my addition could give you some inspirations."
46,38,20170323,7,"Thanks for sharing your understanding about contextual computing.You mentioned that there was a critical hacker attack to the voting system during UmbrellaRevolution in HK, and many believed it was done by Chinese government. You tried toexplain this case with contextual computing. I want to put forward some suggestionstowards the above you mentioned.Even though articles on blogs are not academic researches, I think we should be seriousabout it as well. It would be better to link the reference of the attack event, which wouldmake your writing more reliable and persuasive.Hope my suggestions would help."
33,38,20170323,7,"Thanks for your sharing about the huge impact that digital information put on our lives!Just as you mentioned, information and communication technology has changed ourexperience of place. For example, lots of customers in Mainland China use TaoBao to goshopping online instead of going shopping in a physical mall. For these customers, the place??mall?? has transferred from a physical place to a virtual place. Nowadays, online shoppingis really popular around the world, and creates huge amounts of opportunities for smallscalebusiness.I want to share my understanding about the popularity of online shopping. Compared withtraditional business, online shopping has really low cost and pretty high ROI (i.e. return oninvestment). This allows small-scale business to survive under the monopoly of large-scalebusiness. In other word, online shopping helps improve the equality among business withdifferent scales, which has positive impacts on the whole economy.Hope my understandings about online shopping could give you some inspirations."

Nowadays, there are manyapplications of VR, such as video games, cinema and entertainment, healthcare and clinictherapies, anxiety disorder treatment, pain management, education and training, etc. I wantto introduce more about pain management. VR tech is commonly used in drug-free methodfor pain management. For example, VR with positive experience could help with painreduction.Hope my sharing could help."
34,11,20170323,7,"Good summation of human information interaction! From where I stand, HII is not only a theory in paper, but also a critical issue that the industry is facing. As we are in the age of big data and tons of data is generating everyday which is structured, semi-structured and instructed. We have developed lots of algorithms and infrastructure to mining and processing data to obtain commercial value, but how to display the data to the public is the last yet critical step all the whole chain. Especially in business area, data virtualization seems to be more important. This problem has been caught by some of the top tier companies, for example, Aliyun provides a data visualization service called ???????? to separate data processing with data display. We could change different data visualization board easily as we change the theme of WordPress."
38,11,20170323,7,"Well understanding of the sentiment analysis and opinion mining. For a specific product such as those selling in taobao.com, the entity is much clear as the product itself, and the review quality is high as all the comments are about the product from the customers who actually buy and use it. But for other more general cases, the condition is much though as you need to distinguish useless information from the useful. For this issue, some works have been done to classify documents to several categories using convolutional neural network and you could have a search if you are interested in."
1,11,20170324,7,"NLP really covers a various kinds of areas including but not limited to word vector, translation, opinion mining, sentiment analysis, document classification, document creation. N gram is really a naive approach of NLP as a tutorial for beginners. At the beginning, people tried to generate a set of grammar rules with the help of linguists to teach computer just as how we teach our children but little significant job had been done. Then comes with the statistic methods and N-gram is also one kind. Recently, with the development of machine learning especially deep learning, NLP comes to a new age. By training the deep neural network with huge amount of data, some significant processes have been done. The program could rely with you in text chat just like a human, poems could be translated in a more literal way that even some of the human translators could not distinguish. Some of the news companies are using it for writing news. I think the future of NLP is bright even though some issues are still left to be solved."
34,11,20170324,7,"Amazon Go is a good attempt for the future retailer model but from where I stand, there are still several problems need to be solved. Firstly is the security issue. As the face detection algorithms are much mature than before, but there is still possible to make a mistake for twins or who did a plastic surgery. Even if in a extreme case, some thieves made a mask of a victim and entered the supermarket face his own face but wore the victim mask to take products after entrance. As Amazon Go needs huge amount of computing resources and it is highly possible that it relies on the Amazon Web Service. If there is crush on AWS may disable the whole Amazon Go system. Second is the fault tolerance. For one single Amazon Go shop, it contains hundreds of sensors and what if a critical sensor is failed. If the shop suffers a sudden error which leads to system crush, how about those customers who are shopping. Should they continue to go shopping, taking what they have bought and leave or put everything back?With the creation of Beacon technology, some of the business flow in Amazon Go could be much easier to implement than before. For example, customers?? mobile phone could communicate with sensors for identification instead of face face detection.From Amazon Go, we could also see the strategy or the future of consuming model. The future consuming model is the mixture of online and offline more intelligent instead of the booming of online while the vanishing of the offline."
11,11,20170324,7,"As far as I am concerned, the development of smart city is for the government to manage the cities in a more intelligence and digital way. Teaching the public how to use it is not an necessary. However, withe the further construction of smart city, some of the APIs could be offered to some of the qualified companies to build softwares to better serve the public. Besides, the government could also build the data visualisation platform opening to the public so that we are enable to see how the ??virtual city?? works in a straightforward way. Finally, the government could also provide some of the non secret data to the research institute to find out a better algorithm solving real life problems better."
11,11,20170324,7,"Thanks a lot Jinny. Car sharing is also an efficient ways to lower car density in a crowded an d fast growing. Besides sharing private cars, another solution is to share public cars. In practice the worst traffic condition is the rush hours during which people drives to places to work or from company back to where they live. Some people refuse to take the public transportation because there is no perfect line and they need to transfer twice or more. One solution brought by Shenzhen is to make your personal bus sharing with others which saves time compared with traditional bus while it will not cost too much. From this case, we see the further construction of smart city should also take the intelligent public transportation design into consideration based on traffic flow big data."
11,11,20170324,7,"Honestly yes. The smart city system only could solve partial of the traffic congestion. Based on their test, 5%-11% improvement has been achieved on those test roads. Some congestion may be too serious to be solved by only the intelligent arrangement of traffic light. But the improvement is done without any change or rebuild of the road. As we see, rebuilding is a long term job which leads to more serious congestion during the progress and even a not well redesign will contribute less. Solving traffic jam is only the first step of the whole plan. Furthermore, by collecting traffic data, we could simulate the traffic flow in computer which is helpful for the design of future roads. For example, a new road is planned to be built for releasing traffic congestion in area A, the simulation may tell us if the new road is a necessity, what is the start and end point of the road, how many lanes should it be or in what degree the traffic congestion could be reduced. This might be more helpful for the authorities to make critical decisions for the future of cities."
11,11,20170324,7,"Appreciate for you comment Cici. It seems that smart city is such a huge program or blueprint I say that even if you do a excellent job in one category of all, you may obtain great achievement that may make you rich and famous. Especially in China and US, most of the resources are supported to several super large cities such as Beijing Shanghai in China and New York San Francisco in US. People all go to these top tier cities to seek their future which also leads to ??city disease?? such as traffic congestion, huge consumption of resources pollution etc. Also these cities become the target of attack both in physical and in digital. With the help of big data stack, a smart city could have much process to do. For example, even if 5% electricity reduce in Hong Kong may save a lot. Besides, there is also an agent called Institute of Future Cities in CUHK with Prof Leung Kwong Sak from department of computer science."
11,11,20170324,7,"Hadoop MapReduce(MR) is a very useful batch processing tool with a long period usage in the industry but some disadvantages also could not be ignored. One problem is it needs professional backgrounds to write MR program which limits the use of MR among others such as financial analysts. One solution is called Hadoop Pig. Instead of writing Java or Python, you could write Pig Latin a SQL like language to operate files in HDFS as a SQL table. It takes only 1/60 of original Java code with twice execution time. Pig Latin will be converted into a series of MR jobs automatically. In Yahoo!, 40% of the jobs are in Pig instead of raw MR code. Another Robles is high latency, you may get the result in hours but some data as tweet is generating continuously like water. To get the hot hashtags in the last five minutes, MR is not a good solution. To solve streaming with low latency and high scalability, Apache Storm is created for converting job to a topology instead of map and reduce."
57,11,20170324,7,"When we are talking about how social media such as Facebook, Tweet change the way we interact with information, we should also take the devices that holds the social media into consideration, the mobile phone, or more precisely the smart phone. From where I stand, it is the social media with the smart phone that significantly change the way we generate, interact and consume information. In the past time, we use paper or books to interact with information and the quality of the information is much higher because printing books seems to be a hard and expansive job. During the PC age, we use computers to interact with information but with the restriction of the computer prize, volume and performance, it is still not convenient to access information at any time as well as at any place. But everything has changed with the coming of smart phone. It is economic(1500HKD you may get one), easy to take(put in your pocket) and convenient to use(just flick and click the screen), suitable to record personal information(input text, take a photo or video, record your voice). It is smart phone that make the access of information possible without the limitation of time and space. Beside, the fast development of cellar communication networks speed up the creation of information also."

For example, with the change of agent ??me on the plane?? to ??a little boy on the plane??, the understanding might be ??how beautiful viewing has a positive impact on my mood?? instead of the ??how people are trying to change the environment they live??. With the change of agent??s environment from ??the plane on the sky?? to ??midterm exam room??, the agent??s understanding might be ??how previous hardworking has an impact on my ability of solving problems??. Even if all the four elements are the same, it still has a kind of randomness with the mixture from our previous experience."
38,11,20170324,7,"Nice general explanation on how the Netflix recommending system works. Recommending system is really an important part for most of the retail or e-commerce websites as a well built recommender will provide more extra incomes for the platform. Many recommending algorithms have been developed and on of the most popular one is call A-priori algorithm. Taking this case into consideration, for a consumer buying products online or offline, he or she must have a shopping cart and finally generating orders. For each order, he or she should buy one or more products. If we find out among all orders or baskets, the co-occurance of product A and product B is much higher, we may recommend product B when we see someone is going to buy product A. This recommending strategies are much commonly used in offline retailers such as the supermarkets. How to find out the frequent occurrence of pairs or triples is the problem that A-priori algorithm deal with. I would not say the A-priori in detail and you may google it if you are interested in."
38,11,20170324,7,"How the true process under our brain to generate memory or consciousness is really an attractive but though for us to solve. Simulating the machinism of the neural in human brain is also what the computer scientists interested in for dealing with the tasks that originally only for human such as face recognition, natural language process, pattern matching. To simulate neural in a mathematical way, neural network was proposed several decades before by Hinton who is the chief scientist in Google. Recently, with the developing of GPU, it is possible for people to create a deep neural networks with convolution or recurrent to be well trained with proper time. Even if many excellent works have been done on deep learning, it is still a mystery for us to understand what happen and why it works during the training process and the whole neural network is more likely to be a blackbox with input and output after processing, which is just like the memory process mentioned above ."
1,11,20170324,7,"From where I stand, the way that human interact with information is going to be changed significantly. For the past 60 years, HII has improved a lot. At the beginning, we use paper type with man made holes representing zero and one to write a program which seems more likely to a joke but it??s the truth. Then we used keyboards to type commands for the interaction with information. As the user needs to remember lots of commands, it is not convent for the public to use. After that we have a ball that is able to roll to control a pointer in the screen and comes with the mouse we use today. Recently, with the commercial implementation of Virtual Reality devices, the way we interact with information is facing a huge improvement which we never see before and will have a profound impact on our daily life, on the way we study, the way we communicate with the physical."
13,11,20170324,7,"I think the sentiment analysis doesn??t need a deep understanding of humanity. In the past, for natural language processing problems, the scientists used to try to understand how human use languages. They asked for help from the linguists to build a complex grammar rules to teach computers as they thought language is created by human so it is necessary to understand how people learn and use language firstly. But limited progress was done. For example, computer might know each single word but they don??t understand the relation or sentiment of words. For sentences, they are meaningful as they are related with each other and the environment. ??I like it?? is general and meaningless but if I say ??How nice the car is?? before, ??I like it?? is meaningful and showing my favour to that car with the intention I??m going to buy it. Nowadays, most of NLP breakthroughs come from the application of neural network and deep learning. Ten years age, Yoshua Bengio use neural network to get word vector. Words are presented into a fixed length vector with semantic and syntax. For example, vector(man) ?C vector(women) = vector(king) ?C vector(queen), vector(is) ?C vector(was) = vector(are) ?C vector(were), without tagging each words like dictionary. The strategy is to train the network with billions of sentences and let the computer learn a kind of language by itself without taking the human grammar or languages rules or understandings into consideration."
59,34,20170322,7,"Thank you for sharing your insight on HII based on some examples in real life as a IE student. You mentioned about IE??s boarder knowledge background over specific subjects like CS/EE. Surely we seems to learn much more kinds of material than these subjects and may not as proficient in programming or circuit designing like them. However, I think based on the boarder knowledge we gain, we can gain a global view about the world of engineering. Nowadays, there are many intersected subjects which require more than one background, for example biological computation in EECS, or text mining and NLP in IE. For these subjects, I believe IE students has more advantages."
15,34,20170322,7,"Glad you put forward several points to justify why do we need digital information and how does it differs from sentiment information. You mentioned the transformation from human-understandable sentiment information to digital information is to increase the accuracy in computation. For this point, I am quite curious about how to implement the transformation and give a relatively fair digitalization measurement.As we all know that human emotion are mostly subjective, self defined, and self perceived, so it is really hard to ??measure?? one??s sentiment using digitalized form like number. For example, different people saying ??I am very sad now?? may have various measurement of sad, a sentimental person are much more easy to feel depressed than a optimistic person, and their mentality is different when using same phrase to express their mood. How can computer precisely tell one??s sentiment which sometimes even their close friends cannot get a clue?But I must admit when stepping into the land of digitalization, using numerical expression seems to be the only way. The most critical part is what to measure and how to measure, so that the transformation from sentiment form to digitalized form can be ideal."
15,34,20170322,7,"Thank you for providing a vivid example in real life to illustrate the divergence between three previously mentioned information. I have noticed that in your statement, you consider the evolution from physical information, to digital information as a process of information compression. I partly agree with this analogy, but the compression is not perfect, when encoding data into digitalized form to shrink its size, some semantic meaning of the raw information may lost. Taking answering questions like ??May I sit here??? as a example, in digital form, ??Yes, of course.?? and ??Sure, suit your self.?? may be coordinately encoded into the form of positive feedback, but later one may sounds more polite and willingly. Same as the compression algorithm in image processing, I believe that sentiment compression may also cost certain loss of information richness, but will this loss matters much in sentiment analysis?"
78,34,20170322,7,"Thank your for sharing insight on ""Information Foraging"" here. You express ideas of how human perceive and process information considering limited data flow supported at one time. Different strategies and counter methodologies are implemented to maximize the value of information one receive. I think some perspectives mentioned like ""Information Diet"" and ""Patch Leaving"" are often considered in practical cases of HCI, from fine-grained design in UI, to the big-picture construction in system logic. However, I wish to illustrate that cultivating user dependency may be as critical as satisfying their needs to search more. Sometimes, people are too lazy to change another way of living if they are already used to on way, right?"
18,34,20170322,7,"Thank you for sharing interesting view of considering digital information from the evolution history of digital devices and their screen size. In the last paragraph, you mentioned the aims in the future is to make digital gadgets ??behave?? more like human.From my perspective, ??being human-like?? can be comprehend differently in various fields of application. In terms of ??behaving??, it can be understood as looks more like human in bionics and robotics, thinks more like human in research of neuro network, speaks more like human in study of natural language processing. All these efforts will definitely enrich the transformation system of the three types of information we have mentioned in the class: physical information, semantic information and digital information. Nowadays the transformation from the former two aspects into digitalized form may quite nave and incomplete, with quite some quantity of inline information lost when encoding, but looking forward to the future I believe someday the three forms can be perfectly transformed and boundaries between human behavior and machine behavior will finally disappear as wished."
13,34,20170322,7,"Thank you for contributing this vivid explanation for these three major types of information here. As mentioned in your post and the first following comment, the process of how human being convey information can be described as the evolution all along from physical information to digital information. As in the agreement reached in the previous comments, digital form may never serves as replacement of physical and semantic form, though it offers a much concise and precise channel for communication. Here I want to bring the same argumentation back to stage, but to justify from a different angle: digital information can NOT substitute the other two forms of information because they reflects what really happens in human's deep mind and cannot be easily forged as digital information. Think in this circumstance: you can simply type in words that doesn't speak for your true feeling in WhatsApp, due to it is not a face to face chat and you don't need to prove your honesty by looking into other's eyes and fluently speak out the truth. Human tend to lie more frequently in digital form, and in the context of digital communication, it is not required to provide much physical and semantic content to justify your words."
15,34,20170322,7,"Appreciate your insight in cognition here. According to your sharing, basically there are three levels of cognition. The very first level is pure cognition, human utilize it to identify and classify problems. The second level is metacognition, in this level not only our brain perceives content in the problem, but also conducts analytical process of data, try to find out the best answer. The final level is epistemic cognition, mutual interaction during communication happens in this stage so that in this way it forms the complex interpersonal relationship inline in our species. In previous study (like some chapters in UGFN), beyond cognition, subconscious is also demonstrated as a essential part of forming our view towards the world. In certain ways, it serves as a more deterministic factor than cognition but hard to be realized by ourselves in most cases. What is your opinion on this point?"
11,34,20170322,7,"Glad that you put forward a vivid example to use digital solve practical issues in our daily life. To conquer this common problem of traffic congestion for big cities, Alibaba combines state of art technologies in science and engineering with giant amount of data they have collected. With these altogether, traffic controlling methodologies are efficiently implemented based on the feedback of big data analysis.However, I think it just solves part of the problem. Traffic congestion originated from the reality of super-dense population and optimization-lacked urban planning in central Hangzhou. Taking future into account, urban planning is so critical that it has profound impacts not only on the structure of city but also on quality of everybody??s life. Generally, it determines the trend and the fate of one city for a relatively long time. So I think using current data to simulate future situation could be a interesting topic for urban planning. Just like train, test, and then predict in machine learning, to fully utilize gathered data and constant model, nowadays feedbacks could be guidelines for future plan and design."
13,34,20170322,7,"I really appreciate your insight about contextual computation here. As you stated in the beginning, contextual computation can be divided into two steps?? collecting data and visualizing the result as feed back.Talking about the first step of collecting data, recent years computer vision has been adapted in new types of stores like Amazon Go to gather data by identifying the customers and what they are purchasing, but until now this method is budget consuming and its accuracy is widely doubted when dealing with goods with various shapes. The other method is to place sensors so that the goods can be detected once being moved, like in a vending machine. This method seems quite operable than CV."
38,34,20170322,7,"Memory is what we believe to be as it present our inner reflection of our true self.Like claimed in the main paragraph, I strongly agree with the view that memory can never be fixed and constant. Personally I think when continuously reviewing fractions of our memory, we unconsciously rephrase and reconstruct the content, turning it into what we wish it to be. Take your fascinating memory piece of Cheung Chau Island for example, the coldness, the shine of arising sunlight and the feel of morning sea is so vivid and spectacular probably because you unconsciously ""emphasize"" them each time when you recall this memory out."
25,59,20170322,7,"Thanks for sharing something about VR technology. In this post, you mention that VR can help us to achieve some goals. Here, I want to share another example with you. You know that to achieve virtual reality, the sound should also be modified to indicate its direction. For example, you can clearly identify the difference between the sound from left and right when you playing VR games. This can definitely increase the information entropy of the sound. So, some people start to think, what kind of person can benefit best from this technology? You may have guess that they are the blind. About a few years ago, researches started to develop a system to help the blind to perceive the physical information by using the audio tech in VR. How amazing VR is!"
52,59,20170322,7,"Thanks for your sharing. I am also interested in the topic ""Machine Learning"". Machine contains two parts, supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning mainly focus on learning on the existing data set and get some result from it, such as clustering result. Another is Unsupervised learning, which focus more on prediction. That is to say, computer is trained by a certain size of data set, and establish a proper model for it. Then using model to predict new coming data. Further, we have reinforcement learning, deep learning and so on. Here, I recommend you to try CSCI3320. This is a course about the fundamental of machine learning. It is different from SEEM4680 recommended by the previous person. It is more focus on the foundation of machine learning, which is about math. If you want to know some basic about Machine Learning, you can have a try."
75,59,20170322,7,"Thanks for sharing your perception about machine learning. I am also worried about the future of AI. Is it possible that the machine will heat us? Can we control them safely? I cannot answer these questions. But according to the knowledge of Machine Learning i have learned before, we, human beings, have some characters that machines may meet difficulty to learn. One is about creativity. The main two methods Supervised Learning, which we have learned in class, and Unsupervised Learning are both depend on previous data. Learning system maybe the core part of AI. If future AI is still mainly based on learning system depend on previous data. They may still cannot have creativity. I don't know what will happen in the future, but right now, machine learning and big data do help humans a lot."
4,59,20170322,7,"Thanks For sharing your idea about semantic analysis. Your post also let me think about the limitation of semantic analysis. First, I think semantic analysis is more like a auxiliary than the decision factor. The semantic information we obtained from the internet can help us to get the general idea about something. I think it is why although the accuracy cannot be guaranteed, more and more companies pay attention on it. This may lead to another question. How to evaluate our semantic analysis? It can be applied to many areas and its value may depend on how smart the researcher design the analysis. These may lead to the great fluctuation in values. Also, the result of semantic analysis is more like a prediction on the reality, which will also lead to great uncertainty."
2,78,20170322,7,"It is a fact that Amazon Go is a creative and helpful idea and let us life become much convenient. Meanwhile, your concern about the technology development is right and it reminds me of a famous movie ??The Terminator??.It is a fact that over-developed technology will bring some problem. But it does more good than harm. As a point of my view, as the development of technology, we have much more efficient ways to do things and it is good for our society. Compared with 10 years ago, we have Facebook, Twitter nowadays and they provide a convenient platform for our social activity which help us have much more abundant social activities."
2,78,20170322,7,"A very good perspective in the problem of data collecting. I can not agree more with your point that the data quality nowadays is really bad and there are a lot of ??rubbish?? data in the Internet. Take a famous ??rubbish?? forum (????????) in China as an example. If you try to go through the comments, you will find a lot of advertisements and meaningless comments which is generated by computer. Although we can easily distinguish them, it is a hard work for us to deal with such a large amount of data. Hence, an efficient algorithm to preprocess the data is an interesting and useful topic. The boundary between rubbish and treasure is really subtle in data analyse."
2,78,20170323,7,"Yeah, ambiguity is a really important problem in NLP. And from my perspective, another important difficulty is we don??t consciously understand language ourselves. As for computers, their decision is based on analysing a large amount of data, they will not be influenced by the environment. This is their advantage but also their weakness. Even for human, they can not accurately understand a word/sentence if they do not have any information about the environment which generates the word/sentence. Hence, if we can solve this problem, it is meaningful not only for NLP, but also for the development of Artifical Intelligence. A computer which can analyse problem like a human? It sounds crazy, but really attractive!"
18,78,20170322,7,"A post with clear points. I really agree with you that information interaction is important for software engineer based on the following 3 points:1. It is the base of Internet century.2. Responsibility of a software engineer is to help people percept valuable information efficiently.3. Find people with similar interest and value.However, your point is too general. Even I am not a software engineer, I can also use point 1 and 3 to indicate the importance of information interaction. As for point 2, I think it is much easier for me to understand it if you can provide a few examples."
18,78,20170323,7,"A very clear and detailed post. Use very good examples to show the change of the knowledge world. It is a fact that we can easily get information from all over the world due to the development of Internet. Meanwhile, I also have some ideas about the consequence of the change of the knowledge world. You have listed a lot of merits in the post, however, due to the fast spread of the information, there is a larger chance for us contact with the bad information such as drugs and so on. If someone,especially the child, do not have enough ability to distinguish the bad information, their life will be ruined easily. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Nowadays, how to supervise and manage the large amount of information is a big problem we should take into consideration."
18,78,20170323,7,"Your idea about the comparison between programming language processing and natural language processing really inspired me a lot. It not only helps me have a better understanding of these two concepts, but also shows me that some ideas in computer science is really similar to NLP. However, unlike programming language, human language do not have some limited rules which let its analyse become a much harder mission. Some words can have multiple meanings in different environments. Take ??Thank you?? as an example. Most of the time, it is a good word represents your thanks to other people. However, under some specific situations, someone will use it to irony others. If we can solve this problem, which means a computer can analyse a problem like a human, it will be a big break in the development not only in NLP, but also in Artificial Intelligent. Just like what you have mentioned: ??To some day in the future, people will be able to talk to the computer as if they are talking to a real person.?? And I believe the development of computer science can contribute some creative ideas to this amazing goal."
18,78,20170325,7,"A very interesting post goes though the development of digital devices. It is a fact that it has completely changed our lifestyle. 20 years ago, who can imagine that telephone will become a part of us and we can use it to pay, to live chat with others and so on. However, the fast development of digital devices has also brought a lot of problems. There are more ways for a people to pry others. Security problem of a device and the related software is an important problem to take into consideration. Moreover, as you have mentioned in your post, we may have a ??human-like?? machine in the future.And there is a famous problem which has been discussed for a long time: ??Will the machine take place of human in the future???. What??s your opinion?"
58,78,20170325,7,"Yeah, human interaction is really important as you mentioned. We are highly influenced by the information surrounds us and our reaction to the information will make some changes to the world. Furthermore, I do agree with your ideas about communication system. Human is a ??lazy?? creature.No matter the emergence of language, or the development of the means of communication, the purpose is the same: simplify human interaction. Have a deeper understanding of human interaction can help us find more ways to let human interact with information much effectively. More effective human interaction is a great thruster to the development of our world."
58,78,20170325,7,"An inspiration post talking about contextual computing. It seems attractive if our device can make some decisions for us instead of recommending. However, it is a really difficult topic even we have enough data to analyze. Take myself as an example, I will have a strong desire to eat something without any reason. Human??s mind is the most difficult to predict because we do not have a actual image of what we want sometimes. It is similar to one of the difficulties in natural language processing:?? Human do not have a actual understanding of the meaning of the language.?? Solving these problems requires our machine to behave like a human. It is a really difficult but interesting area. But nothing is impossible. We can never predict the development of technology, I hope these problems can be solved in the future which will make a big change to our life!"
58,78,20170325,7,"Very clear explanation of semantic information, sentiment analysis and opinion mining. It will be much better if you can have some details of the procedure of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. I believe most of us are much more interested in details instead of general definitions. And as a point of my view, there are sevral difficulties we need to deal with in sentiment analysis and opinion mining. For instance, in your picture, the icon is chair obviously. But there are a lot of icons which have multiple meanings in different situations. Even for human, if they do not have any information of the environment which generates these icons, they can not distinguish their meanings. Hence, it is much difficult for machines because they make a decision based on a large amount of data. They will not consider the influence of a specific environment. It is really a big challenge. If we can solve it which means our machine can perform like a human, it will be a great milestone of human development."
58,78,20170325,7,"A very concise and clear post which initiates us into a frequently used technique in machine learning called k-means cluster. It is a useful algorithm which lets the computers classify and group the similar data automatically. It is the most basic but important step in data analyze. When we build the word dictionary in our group project one, I think this is a useful skill we can take into consideration because we can classify the similar words into a same cluster."
13,78,20170325,7,"A great post summarizes three types of information clearly. I do agree with your idea that the flourish of digital information helps people obtain semantic and physical information much easier. Nowadays, we can easily gain any information we want through Internet ?? a network makes main contribution to the fast spread of digital information. However, there are some problems we should take into consideration which brought by the Internet. First of all, it is a fact that we can get any type of information much easier. But from another perspective, it means that we won??t spend such a long time to prove the correctness of the information we obtain. Furthermore, fast spread of information also lets our private information become much easier to be leaked. Security problem is really important in information era."
77,78,20170325,7,"A concise post represents how human receives information and be influenced by it. There is also a brief introduction to Shannon??s information theory. It will b better if you can give us some detailed examples. I think this can help us have a better understanding of the content. And as a point of my view, I am confused about your idea: ?? information has both physical and mental aspects.?? As mentioned in class, we can get physical information from an object and semantic information from others (E.g. language). And nowadays, both of them will be converted to digital information for high-speed interaction. Hence, I can??t understand the meaning of the mental aspects of information. I look forward to your response to help me solve this confusion. Thanks."
57,78,20170325,7,"Your post inspires me a lot, especially for the parts discussing invisible virtual meaning of words. Based on your post, language is really complex which makes its analyze become much harder. As we know, words have different meanings in different environments and there are a lot of new words generated by the Internet every day. We can not understand the meaning of a new word unless we have some information about the environment generates this word. Hence, it will be much harder fro a machine to analyze the language. It is a difficult but interesting area and it is related t your post. I hope you can like it."
33,78,20170325,7,"Your post really interests me a lot and helps me have a better understanding of VR. When I was a child, I have dreamed of acting as a warrior to a save the world in the real life. As the development of VR technology, I believed my dream will come true in the future as the emergence of some VR RPG games. However, when we are talking about virtual reality, there is a problem we should take into consideration: ??If all of us lives in a virtual world which is constructed by computer and all of us think this world is the real world we live.At this time, for us, what is the reality? What is the virtual? ?? It is an interesting and profound problem about VR. What??s your opinion? Looking forward to your reply."
57,18,20170322,7,"Thanks for your post on philosophy of user interface design. The second rule attracts me a lot that users are diverse and design shall be always catering to universal usability. It is known that the Apple Inc. is always leading the design philosophy in public consumer product. Before iOS 7, all the design style of mobile phone is trying to imitate the real world. From notes pad to alarm clock, designers draw the icon and control button in the way it looks like in the real world. However, from iOS 7, they changed the style into flattening. I believe the reason behind is that users are more and more adapt to the mobile phone. They are pretty clear about the buttons, icons and photos. In this way, the flat design can reduce much more information burden for users and it makes the interface cleaner and tidier. This kind of change is corresponded to the second rule of interface design, which I think is a very brilliant conclusion."
2,18,20170322,7,"Thank you for sharing the difficulty of NLP. I think it is absolutely correct that NLP is a remaining difficulty for not only engineering but also linguistics. As you have mentioned, NLP is a subdomain of artificial intelligence, I think that??s why lots of scientists are trying to solve this problem by stimulate a ??brain?? inside the computer. Like the neural network, it is more like a simpler version of human brain that we can train it with data and relationships. I personally believed that the day we solve the problem of NLP is the day that we can fully imitate a human inside the computer. It is really fascinating that someday we might create some artificial intelligence creature that is something like we saw in the Westworld."
58,18,20170322,7,"Your explanation is very clear and concise. I think I have already got a general picture of the K-means clustering. I believe that the clustering is related to the unsupervised learning area of machine learning. It can help people classify the objects and cluster the similar goods. In terms of the commercial usage, I think people can leverage the technique in a lot of areas like junk mail filtering or products recommendation. With the development of big data, more and more machine learning technique become feasible and meaningful. Hopefully in the future, with adequate data for training, our computers can become smarter and more considerable."
78,18,20170322,7,"Your observation on information foraging theory and product design is really brilliant. It is very important that we should reduce the information burden and barriers for users getting information. It is quite lazy that users are always trying to acquire the information with the lowest effort. As I have stated in the other post(link), there is some design method to reduce the information burden. Apart from that, putting the main information in the conspicuous position is a good choice. In terms of SEO, it is a very traditional way that people used to increase the exposure of their products. And in the mobile era, search engine decreased its importance. However, social network services occupied more time of users and that??s probably why Facebook is growing at such a fast pace"
21,9,20170324,7,"It is important to make the reviews reliable for the users especially when we are doing online shopping. As we can't touch or pick the real products up to have a trial on it's quality during online shopping, the only way that we can get more information about that products is to see the reviews. Once the reviews goes wrong, people will stop believing the reviews. They won't take the risk trying if the products come with expectation. The online shopping website will then become fail.Another example is the Taobao in China. Most the products in Taobao usually receive positive rating or even using fake account to pretend the buyers and wrote the fake comments. That's why people trust Amazon rather then trusting Taobao."
21,9,20170324,7,"It??s good that you mentioned the privacy issues. Indeed, privacy issues is always one of the major concern that oppose the implementation of new technologies. Nowadays, there are more and more CCTV on the streets. This can really restrict people from committing crime. With the use of face recognition, we can easily find out the leaving path of the gangsters using the CCTV. We have to make a balance point about the privacy problem and the efficiency of the new technologies. To deal with this, we should limit the accessibility of such information obtained and make sure that the information is only used for crime issues. With this, I highly believe that the face recognition can be widely used on the coming days ."
21,9,20170324,7,"I appreciate that you give a deep explanation on the pros of machine learning. It seems that you know deeply about machine learning. However, like what Kelvin mentioned before, this is just the ideal case of machine learning. Indeed, the collection of database still has to be investigate and make it useful in the future. This is not just a matter of time to make this technology mature."
5,9,20170324,7,"Internet become more and more common. People can easily get information from the Internet. With this background, it is important for us to distinguish if the information we get is correct. When we see some shocking news, we keen to believe it because we want something interesting. Yet, if we trust every news that we receive from the internet, we will easily being misled. I heard someone said that: control the media, you can control the mind of the public. I did trust this sentence when I was in my high school but now I do. One of the things that we should learn in university is that we should learn to think critically. Otherwise, we will be led by the media, but not the truth."
5,9,20170324,7,"It is good to see that you enthusiastic about serving the community. As an engineer, we are actually serving the community using our knowledge. Nowadays, the use of internet makes life more convenient and comfortable. Yet, the number of cyber-related crimes is rising. With the information engineering training done by our major program, we can use our internet expertise on policing work.we can??t change the stability of the politic atmosphere, but we can try our best, using our expertise, to make Hong Kong a safe city."
10,9,20170324,7,"The trend of online shopping become more and more popular. We can learn something good from the biggest trading website in China - the Taobao trading website. we can see that we are using different ways to improve the quality of purchasing. The website is designed to be user friendly. I think, with the study of digital environment, we can create a better experience of online shopping."
10,9,20170324,7,"The sentiment analysis is a very useful ways to analyst comments! sometimes, we might be hard to give marks on a scale to represent how we feel bout this products. The simplest way is to give a comment on words! With this background, we can easily get to know how user think of our products by using the sentiment analysis. Yet, this has to be used carefully as adding a word like not/non/a/in will totallychanged the meaning"
10,9,20170324,7,"I want to mention something about traditional media( like news paper, radio news) and the internet media. The main difference between these 2 objects is about the reliability. Traditional media seems to be losing the popularity as we cannot give feed-backs and have discussion about a specific topics. However, the information post by such traditional media is guaranteed to be, although not 100%, true. Therefore, it do has its value. I agree that having interaction is one of the benefits of online media. Yet, we have to think about the reliability."
37,9,20170324,7,"Thanks for you post! computers are being widely used nowadays. I do think that it??s a must for us to learn how the computers see things. The similarity measures is one of the methods that we can use. We are actually using data to represent pictures! For human ourselves, we can find out how similar 2 things are by using our sensations. However, computers can??t do such jobs. that??s why we have to introduce the similarity measures to communicate with the computers!"
37,9,20170324,7,Thanks for your post! Semantic Information is the linkage between physical stuff and the meaning that we get. I think one of the difference between human being and artificial intelligence is that we will create something meaning but useless. Like the songs/music/poem/arts. Our mind is actually very powerful!

68,55,20170322,7,"Thank you for the sharing and I do agree that nowadays with the advancement of technology, Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming more and more popular.In our reality, everything that we know comes by way of our senses and how we experience reality is by the combination of our brains sense-making organisms as well as sensory information. With VR, it ables to present human's senses with a computer generated virtual environment that people able to explore and experience different things. Each and everyone can design their own visual images to be shown on the virtual reality for their own unique experience. Just as children, they can see different beautiful sceneries from other countries if they do not have the chance to visit the countries. I believe that more innovative uses for this technology will be invented in the future and perhaps not a in long while this can be used to communicate and work between different people."
39,55,20170322,7,"Thank you for your sharing. It is so true that nowadays, User Experience (UX) design is an important aspect for different products. As UX is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product through improving the accessibility and usability for a better interaction for users. This can make the product user-friendly and users feel comfortable using it. As a user of different products, I do agree that a better UX design can make things easier and I will be more willing to continue using the products. I think with a great UX design, it can surely increase sales as more people will be purchasing the products and increases customer's satisfaction. I believe with such design, it will surely make people's lives better and benefiting companies, users and everyone in the world."
27,55,20170322,7,"Thank you for your sharing and I am having the same points of view as you do on how important semantic analysis is nowadays. By semantic analysis, it can surely reflect the popularity of a product which may allow the companies to take reference on people's preferences and make further improvements to their products. This can also save a lot of time for the companies knowing about consumer's views without asking individually. People's reactions and feedbacks are always the fey factors that lead to the success of a product. Hence, semantic analysis is really a useful tool and I believe this will be further development that can help companies to develop more and more good products to benefit the whole society."
75,55,20170322,7,"Thank you for your sharing and you made a good point about Machine Learning. I do agree that although the use of Machine Learning has been boosting these days, there should be a control for the machines and it should not replace human in the future. This is really a great technology transformed computers to be just like human and able to process different information that are useful for human to do different analysis. Machine Learning can help with the data analysis of different online media performance as well as through facial recognition and spoken language understanding. I believe in the near future, more and more different functions or human actions can be done by machines and it will surely be our good assistances in our daily life."
6,55,20170322,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I think that nowadays people are widely expose to different digital information through different channels, including newspapers, radio, Internet, etc. Information is simply available at the touch of a button and this brings people to stay connect with the whole world. However, this brings to the problem that you mentioned which is people will be greatly rely on these information. People seldom apply critical thinking to analyse whether the information is true or not, so it gives rise to many different problems, including the spread of rumours, misleading the public on the knowledge that can be acquired and affecting human in making decisions. Hence, I think that it is useful to have more information provided for human to acquire but people should think carefully about the authenticity of the information."
61,55,20170322,7,"Thank you for your sharing. There is no doubt that Smart City is an inevitable development in the future. It will surely enhance people's life and the way of living by perceiving human contexts. Just as Hong Kong, the government is developing Hong Kong to become a world's leading Smart City. This can help to enhance people's quality of life foster the knowledge economy through applying different Information Technology. This can enhance the resources management and allow information exchange to be more effective. I am looking forward for Hong Kong transforming to a Smart City and everyone can experience in this digital environment."
45,55,20170322,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I understand more about different applications that related to Internet of Thing (IoT) and being used in our daily life. IoT really brings a lot of convenience to our daily life and making great impacts to our world by transforming it to a better one. With such great technology, information can easily be transmitted and at the same time reach automatically to human behaviours. I believe in the near future, more applications of IoT will be makes people's life a lot easier in different aspects, such as education aspect and manufacturing aspects. This technology is having positive impacts on our world and I am looking forward to the transformation."
55,51,20170324,7,"The advancement of technology is indeed a double-edged sword, it made our lives more convenient but it somehow is also dumbing us down. There is definitely a possibility that technology would replace humans in certain aspects but I doubt whether it could fully replace all human beings. The uniqueness of human beings is our creativity. Take daily language as an example, slangs are created everyday and this is something that machines would not be able to do so. It would be terrifying if machines could think and act like people."
69,51,20170324,7,"The one-click button of Amazon might be a very convenient UX design for some customers but it is a bit confused for me as I don??t use Amazon that often. This design might not work that well for Asians, especially for people who are not that familiar with smartphones, as we tend to trust things we can see rather than online payment, and the button could easily be pressed accidentally. That??s why transnational corporations need to have different managers for different regions to change their marketing strategies in order to satisfy customers from different nations."
3,51,20170324,7,"I have come across some journals about expert system when researching for my FYP. Indeed, researchers have already been exploring the possibilities in replacing experts such as doctors and lawyers with machines so as to reduce manpower. However it is an extremely difficult job as even the same symptoms can mean different illnesses. Wrong judgements might severely harm or even kill the patients. That??s why the research in expert system has stopped for a while. There is still a long way to go in the research and development of automatic doctors."
3,51,20170324,7,This blog reminds me of my trip to Japan a few years ago. Our tour guide repeatedly warned us about not to do certain hand gestures (e.g. the gesture of number nine in HK means robbing in Japan) to avoid confusion. It is sometimes quite irritating to see people snapping their fingers to servers at restaurants as it is very impolite to do so. Sometimes I would hope that sign language is a compulsory course for everyone so that people would know how rude they are and would stop doing such things to others.

Whenever I was taking a programming course, I always wonder how did the inventors came up with such ideas and create these sophisticated programming languages that made our lives so much easier. This also apply to the languages that we speak. Although I am an engineering student, I am more interested in linguistics. After all, without the creation of spoken and written language, everything we are using nowadays would only be fantasies and could never be achieved."
39,51,20170324,7,"I do think that social media has enhanced the speed of spreading information. However another problem that concerns me is how could we determine whether the information or news are correct? Take Wikipedia as an example, everyone can edit the information on the site and there are not many ways that we can verify the authenticity of these information. Thus the next development direction should be developing systems that can help the verification of information and news online."
50,51,20170324,7,"Talking about making business decisions, do you still remember the advertisement of Nestle White Coffee? The marketer of Nestle has made good use of sentiment analysis (Facebook reactions of Leon Lai??s official Facebook fan page) to choose the spokesperson. From the interviews, the marketer has explained that Leon Lai is one of the most influencing Hong Kong idol digitally and he receives the least negative reactions (i.e. sad and angry reactions) every time he updates his fan page. This is an extremely successful example of the use of sentiment analysis that I have heard of so far."

The biggest one is probably the Singles?? Day Festival (Nov 11). In 2016, their sales have reached 102 billion yuan, even more than Black Friday sales in United States. However, this shopping spree has created a lot of problems afterwards as people just randomly buy things on Nov 11 but then return the goods, over half of the sold items on Singles?? Day are returned to be exact. Taobao is notorious for its excessive packaging and such act is a waste of resources and manpower.

I agree with your point that social media can have good and bad influence on the society.For the advantages, i agree that knowledge are now more accessible with the bloom of internet. In the past centuries, if you want to learn a craft or acquire new knowledge, you either become a apprentice of a skillful person or go to the libraries and learn and read more about the topic.Social media and the information bloom helps people share their knowledge. A simple search on Youtube ??How to"" would instantly spawn up to billions of informative videos, from cooking lessons, how to care for your plants and even programming tutorial!knowledge are more accessible with social media bloom.However, false information may also be spread. With the information overload, ??Clickbaits"" appears. We are receiving many information a day and some publishers would sometimes use dramatic and exaggerated titles to attract viewers. Internet users seldom filter those information and take it as facts. It would cause some false information to circulate the internet."
10,32,20170324,7,"It is good that you bring up the point that analyzing human information interaction to optimizing product design. Product design should be a never ending process by inputting users feedback, and output a renew design to optimize the process.Human information analysis can be a huge tool to aid the collecting of data."
6,32,20170323,7,"I agree that information overload is affecting the society right now.In recent years, false information are flooding the internet and web publishers would often use dramatic and exaggerated titles to attract viewers. It often results in false information spreading across the world.In the rise of information system, there should also be guidelines and rules to regulate use of internet to catch up the pace of information bloom."
6,32,20170323,7,"It is really interesting in how publishers play with words to create creative titles. In the modern days, translation with computers are so common, we should also look into how to translate these kinds of titles with machine learning and obtain the context the author is trying to express."
27,32,20170324,7,"I agree with you on the point of collecting data to further improve a game.Even with mcdonald??s, I think are using similar methods to collect customers opinion. Using customers feedback, they could improve on less popular food and raise the price on popular food. Every industries could benefits from sentiment analysis."
27,32,20170324,7,"I totally agree with your point!Information bloom are creating false advertisement on the internet, when a business wants more customers, they would sometimes buy ??fake reviews"" to boost their reputation. It would drives out all the genuine reviews and we would all be reading false reviews all the time.To avoid that, users should always learn how to filter out false and fake reviews."
27,32,20170324,7,"I totally agree with your point!As an Information Engineering students myself, I myself benefits from human information interaction too. When I have trouble with topics, I would always look up on Youtube or Google. You made a very good argument. Thanks!"
66,10,20170322,7,"I agree with what you have mentioned. Social Media analytics is an important part for planning today's marketing strategies. Nowadays, people rely on social networking, and the benefit of commercial advertisements on these platforms can be greater than imagine. With these analytical data, we can have a clearer view on what people are interested in, and thus a better planning. Its definitely a pro for the businessmen and should be widely applied in the field."
44,10,20170322,7,"I agree that programming skills and UX are both important for developing a good application, both part cannot be neglected. Sometimes, programmers only focused on the coding and implementation, but with UX, we can have better understanding on how the end users would need the application to be, and what suits them most."
3,10,20170325,7,"Thanks for sharing. Body language is an interesting topic to learn, if it is used correctly, it can facilitate the communication. Actually, we use body language to help represent us all the time, like sometime we would do without thinking. However, from your blog, I understand that there's maybe different meaning for the same gesture in different culture, in order to avoid being offensive to others, we should explore more about the gestures, especially before travelling."
51,10,20170325,7,"I agree that emoji is weakening our language ability. Nowadays, people always use emojis to represent their feeling, or even to replace wordings, which sometimes causes misunderstanding. For example, sometimes using a doesn??t mean that person is really smiling, it may represent that guy is feeling mad, and does not want to talk to you. It sounds weird, but it is actually happening frequently. However, I think this is a new form of communication, if it can be used wisely/correctly, emojis should have being favouring our online conversations instead. What I think that is really weakening our language ability is those ??Chinglish??, sometimes they are really not that readable?? :S"
6,10,20170325,7,"I agree that no. of rumours are increasing significantly with the developing of information technology. Since it is too easy to get different information online, such as typing in the keywords to Google, and all related information can be found. People normally tends to believe what the found at once and share them to their friends/relative, without even justifying whether the news/info is true or not. Thus, it is important for us to think twice, before believing and sharing the info. online."
32,10,20170325,7,"Sentiment analysis is really important for every company, especially when everyone is relying on the internet, and a lot of blogger/Youtuber are always sharing product reviews online. By doing sentiment analysis, the company can understand more about the pros and cons of their product, and thus developing their company business with different marketing strategy. It is sort of the best way to understand the online market nowadays."
55,10,20170325,7,"Thank you for sharing. I agree that the digital environment are favouring learning and it is providing a really good social platform. However, I think the usage of internet and digital information are somehow being abused. Although it is difficult to regulate how people use the internet and what they do/say online, I think educating the teens/new generation how to make use of the advantages of the digital environment is an essential part."
10,76,20170325,7,"I agree with you about the drawback of social media. Since there is too many information online, some of them may be incorrect. As a result, we should only trust information or news from trustworthy source online."
12,76,20170325,7,"I think social media also provide a good platform for us to keep connect with friends overseas easily. For example, we can update the current life of overseas friends by viewing his/her posts/photos on social media!"
14,76,20170325,7,"Thank you for giving a very specific example on social cognition. In my own idea, actually if you believe you know the truth (2+2=4), you can find evidence to support yourself and also try to convince others back."
25,76,20170325,7,"Thank you for sharing ideas on HII. In my own opinion, besides HII is important for engineering/computer science student, I think we (the student) actually take an important role in HII deveopment. As a result, if we can equip ourself with good knowledge of HII, we can help develop this field a lot!"
25,76,20170325,7,"Thank you for sharing information about VR technology in different aspects. Besides those aspects that you have mentioned in your blog post, VR technology also benefit the video gaming aspect. Traditionally, video games only provide 2D environment to players. However, after introduce the VR technology, players can now play in ""real"" environment. This really enhance the player experience and create many possibilities for video gaming industry."
25,76,20170325,7,"Machine learning is really a big topic recently, more and more services and fields started to introduce machine learning. However, one of the major concern is that, if machine learning technology keep develops, then will one day machine replace human? In my own opinion, I think the answer is no. It is because there always exists some new information that cannot be ""learnt"" by the machine itself. In those case, human play an important role in introducing those new information to machines."
27,76,20170325,7,"Thank you for sharing your experience to us. I agree that recommendation system helps us a lot by providing ideas and choices for us when we don't have idea to chose which products. It makes our life more easier and convenience. However, after reading your blog post, I will definitely be more careful to follow the recommendations from any recommendation systems."
32,76,20170325,7,"I think your point of view on the relation of computer with music is interesting! In my own opinion, I think music is a media used by human to communicate, for example to teach and to entertain as you said. However, for computer, I think it is a platform for human to use. In conclusion, I don't think computer and music can be compare in the way you said. But I do agree computer (Internet) provides a great possibilities for music industry."
32,76,20170325,7,"Thank you for introducing the history of computer. In my own opinion, I think the AI technology will play an important in computing application. As AI technology develops rapidly, nowadays AI can actually replace human in more aspects. In computing application, I do think AI technology may develops computer software in the coming future."
45,76,20170325,7,"Thank you for introducing the idea of HII to us, I love your diagram very much, it demonstrates the idea of HII very clearly and accurately. I also agree the HII is important for engineering student, so we must equip ourself with solid knowledge of HII, in order to catch up the latest development of information technology!"
45,76,20170325,7,"Thanks you very much for introducing contextual computing to us. Before reading your post, I actually don't realize that there are so many services and products in daily life involve contextual computing. I understand your concerns on the privacy issue on contextual computing, many people don't realize they have lacked their personal information to others when using contextual computing, for example people always click yes to user agreement even they didn't read it. We must be very careful not lacking sensitive information to un-trusted source."
45,76,20170325,7,"I do have played Pokemon Go! The embedded AR technology is really interesting and enhance user experience a lot. However, I found that if I turn on the AR mode when catching Pokemon, my phone become slow in response. I believe it is because AR technology requires a lot of computation power. As a result, in order to play the game smoothly, I must turn off the AR mode and thus cannot enjoy the most interesting part of the game :("
43,76,20170325,7,"I actually think that social media do enhance friendship by providing platforms to let us to communicate and keep in touch with friends. You may be correct about not everyone will post everything on social media. However, if there is no social media, it is difficult for us to keep in touch with friends that rarely meet, for example friends in overseas. As a result, I believe social media helps us develop friendship with friends."
55,76,20170327,7,"In my own opinion, I believe human cannot be replaced by machine. It is because I believe there will always be some new ""elements"" appear in the World, and human have the ability to learn and adapt the new ""elements"". However, machine can only learn from previous knowledge, and lacks the ability to adapt new things."
39,76,20170327,7,"I agree with you, the reason why digital information is important is because nowadays nearly all information is transmitted by the computer network. If information need to transmit through computer network, then it must converted to digital information first. So, why all information is transmitted through computer network? I believe it is because transmitting information through computer network is fast and most of the time accurate."
23,76,20170327,7,"What a interesting idea! Thank you for sharing. I think this blog post is related to the idea of machine learning. In my own opinion, surely I think machine learning is good and can brings convenience to us. However, I doubt the idea that machine can design whole new product that people cannot imagine. I believe, at lease in the time, human is still more creative than machine."
7,8,20170323,7,"This postI agree that it??s interesting to know how human make choices in life. The invention of recommendation system is great for us, especially in the digital century. For example, ??Suggested Post?? feature of Facebook, ??Genius Recommendation?? feature of iTunes etc makes amazing recommendations that based on our activities and likes.This kind of system can help us to explore new things due to the recommendations, and get close to our friends which we can see what they liked in Facebook or bought items in iTunes. Personally, I do have more and more common topics with my friends and we know each other much better than before. To conclude, recommendation system really help our daily life a lot."
9,8,20170324,7,"As we do translate human language to computer language, it is really a hard job at start. However, we perfectly solved the problems that we encountered and now we are much more easy to communicate with others through computers. Also, we can better command the computer to do what we do. Digital information is becoming more and more important in our daily life."
27,8,20170324,7,"Sentiment analysis is a great for us to know more about the products from the others comments, as what you said, to gather past experiences and have a better acknowledgement of the products. Some feedbacks maybe nagative which remind the buyer that may have awful experiences that the others went through. This can also help the companies to improve what they are really bat at. I believe such reactions and interactions can help futher improvement of everything, including the products, buyers?? experiences or even more."
42,8,20170323,7,Cognition of human involves not only information that read by our brain but also how such thinking and mental process influence our actions. Adopting a scientific approach is a good attempt to investigate human cognition but I afraid this is a hard process to success completely interprete how human really cognite.
43,8,20170324,7,"I totally agree what u say, this situation is like ??hi-bye"" friends in real life. For me, I wont share eveything in facebook or instagram. I prefer share with my friends face to face, these kind of social platform can only help you and your friends keep in touch in a simple way but not deeply."
67,8,20170324,7,"Everyone noticed that the problem that you mentioned. However, only a few of us can improve and change our attitude on the real interaction between ourselves and the others. Social media are actually help people get closer but people are really misusing them and make the bad phenomenon nowadays."
9,8,20170324,7,"Virtual Reality (VR) is a powerful invention which can help people to face lots of fantasy scenes that wont happen in real life, and also to let the user experience different feelings base on what way the VR is used. VR creates physical information that can really help people in various ways of usage. For example, gaming, medical, training etc."
12,8,20170323,7,"Personal privacy is a serious concern in cyber world nowadays, we wont read most of the provision as we all want to speed up everything and easily drop into the trap to lose some of our personal information."
20,8,20170324,7,"Thankyou for your sharing of the concepts learnt in the lecture. For the concept of satisficing, most people wont really spend that much time to understand or learn the environmrnt first and they prefer trying in order to get the outcome they want whch is time-saving and convenient a lot. This behavior is worth to futher investigate to implant in our programming or works."
16,8,20170324,7,"The problem that you mentioned are happenning everything. Let me take a example, we all know Openrice, we all use this website to find out which restaurant we are going to. However, some restaurant mentioned that they have to pay for Openrice in order to have a better spot in the recommendation page and even the rating! We must know how to determine the truth and dont overconfident on the feedback system in cyber world."
16,8,20170324,7,"For me, I am feeling excited about the development of VR. As the social pressure is extemely high in Hong Kong, I prefer total islated from the real world and step in the virtual world that I looking foward to do what I want and relax or enjoy. There is a famous cartoon called ??Sword Art Online"" which indicate what can the VR become in the coming future and I always hope that this can be comes true in the time of my life."
24,8,20170324,7,"Although we all looking forward to the development of AI, there are still lots of concern on the cons of AI in the future. We all know that AI are nearly can replace human to do lots of works, but this may lead to job loss. Is this kind of digital development are really good for human? This question is worth to investigate. We watched lots of science fiction movie that artificially intelligent machines began to think for themselves, what we suppose to treat them as? A life or just machine? Well, time will tell us everything."
21,8,20170324,7,"Amazon really do a great job on ensuring the quality of the reviews. Fake and malicious comments can always left by the competitors. People are often misdirect by those reviews, so this mechanism maintained by amazon is really good for people who really want to reference from reviews. This serious attitude of amazon is worth to learn by other review systems."
23,8,20170324,7,"For product design, I think it??s just a starting point for that. The reason is it really hard to calculate all of the components and make sure that the design is really work. Also, the idea that suggested by the system maybe not be new too."
25,8,20170324,7,"I agree that VR is becoming more and more useful to the society nowadays. As you mentioned that the usage is so widely, and we can use it on lots of way. I looking forward to see how VR really benefits to the human society in the future. The mainly usage of VR for now that I know is on gaming and hope that it can be really function on medical part or even other ways."
28,8,20170324,7,"Technology really makes our life more simplier and plentiful. We all know that everything has their pros and cons, so that I think what you mentioned, like jobs are replaced by machines is the least price of getting those benefits. However, I think man power is indispensable. The reason is machines are not reliable as human, there still have the chance that machine maintainances, or some sudden malfunction. Therefore, I think these technologies are just our auxiliary tools and can??t really replace us."
53,6,20170325,7,"Your view is very interesting, I agree with you that Cantonese is hard to classify its means. For example, we like to satire others by some positive words. Therefore it is not effective in Cantonese, but I am looking forward to see the result."
53,6,20170325,7,"I agree with you the advertisement help us a lot, but sometimes the advertisement is very annoying. It always disturb me from surfing the net. If the advertisement can have some customer setting would be better."
53,6,20170325,7,"Right! HII is how we exchange message with each other, and it is include face-to-face interaction and internet interaction. By HII, we can improve our living standard by exchanging the opinions. It helps globalization though the world."
40,6,20170325,7,"The sentiment analysis is useful for some areas of comments, for example the film review and restaurant grading. These two areas is relatively straight forward, therefore it is easy to detect some of the sentiment wordings. But for some more complex comments, it is not effective at all."
63,6,20170325,7,"I agree with you, but sometimes the abuse of information will make user confuse. Of course context computing is essential, but we need to have a well use of it."
3,6,20170325,7,"You are right, I agree before using these body languages, we have to be familiar with it. Otherwise, it may lead to some embarrassments. Just like different countries have their own traditions. Actions in different countries may have different meanings. Therefore we have to be careful before we speak and act."
3,6,20170325,7,"Thank you for the sharing, in my point of view, i agree get use of recommender systems can make profits. Just like the advertisement in facebook. It always shows the recent type of things you have search. Using recommender systems can enhance the chance for searching suitable things for users. But it also limit the shopping diversity for user."
3,6,20170325,7,"I cant agree anymore with your opinion, It is a very creative example, and please let me modify your equation. I think using E = 1/2 mv can better explain it. Because only some of the people will spread the information out, and some of them is just receive the information."
73,6,20170325,7,"Thank you for your sharing, I have experience Foraging Theory when I am doing my homework. I search from google to find some useful materials for my homework, but i always find some useless website. I think the reason is the upload know well about Foraging Theory, and set the title that is suitable for our needs."
26,6,20170325,7,Thank you for your sharing. About ??What is the future of Digital Interaction through machine learning??? I got some thoughts. I think the machine can substitute human to do some dangerous work such as building sites and some disgusting works. It can enhance our living standard.
26,6,20170325,7,"I agree with you. Social Media is one the powerful mind control method to affect people. For example like north Korea and China, we can see how the media control limits peoples mind."
45,6,20170325,7,"Thank you for your explanation, in CUHK we have using some IoT also, such as our CU link, the light sensor in hostel. IoT make our life better and more convenient, And there is one popular IoT in HK, it is octopus card. I think in the future we should keep modifying the use of octopus card and make it become an electronic money platform."
45,6,20170325,7,"Thank you for your sharing, your post remind me about an animation about full diving VR. Full diving VR is direct transmit information to our brain and receive the signal that our brain transmit to body. It can simulate the reality and will not affect our body in real world. I am looking forwarding to have this technology."
61,6,20170325,7,"I agree that Smart City can enhance our quality of lives a lot by perceiving human contexts so the systems can provide an appropriate response to users?? needs. I am looking forward to have a smart city to live in. But at the same time I got another question, it is how we can maintain the city? Prevent it by some attack? Smart City is control by a n internet. If the internet is under DDos attack, how can we to keep the order in the city? I think we should find out the balance between a smart city and safety."
39,6,20170325,7,"I totally agree with you!!! ??User satisfaction is everything!!!?? Nowadays, many program or apps is focusing on the function but not the user satisfaction. Therefore UX design in the product in important. It not only reduce the time for some repeatable actions, it also make the user feel happy!!!!!"
39,6,20170325,7,"I agree with you, the internet is popular in 21 century, people like to share different things in the social media platform. And it will cost to a spreed in information. By reading different information and critique by others, people can think in different ways and enhance the creation."
63,27,20170325,7,"I totally agree your definition to the difference between human cognition and digital cognition. Computer is learnt from us. Nowadays machine learning not only gets involve in the communication only. IBM Watson (which is a machine learning program) had produced and movie trailer Morgan! Machine learning are spread to all aspects. Undoubtedly, it enhances and facilitate human life, also improve the efficiency. It will create lots of risk. However, I am a bit worried about the development of machine learning since until a certain time, the machine will replace human completely if we over-rely on the computer. We need to use machine learning in a suitable way."
52,27,20170325,7,"I totally agree the importance of semantic Information and languages. As online shopping is a big trend in the world. We will observe other customers' opinion for our reference for whether buying/using their product/ service. It is for customer's aspect. For the company's aspect, the company can collect the semantic information of the customer comment on the social platform. The company can analyze by semantic analyze to evaluate their product/ service. In order to improve their competitive power to similar products. Therefore, the NLP is very important in the information era as you said. As an information and CS students, it is a big chance for us to get a job opportunity to develop NLP for the company."
35,27,20170325,7,"I agree with your worry on the accuracy of the sentiment classification. As the project we are doing, we have discovered not the ""positive"" and ""negative"" word mean in the comment. If we put a ""not"" before a positive or negative adjective, the whole meaning will become opposite and the sentiment analysis will be lead to failed. The ""good"" product become bad and not sell leading decreasing profit and the ""bad"" product become good and keep on selling leading to loss. Therefore, the sentiment classification should be well-trained before using. Moreover, there will be a malicious or spam comments to attack the company. Therefore, the sentiment analysis should be trained to filter or delete those unrelated comment in order to prevent the accuracy of the sentiment classification. Therefore, we need to work hard our project together. Fighting!!!!"
35,27,20170325,7,"Yes, the perception and the ability of human being is limited. Therefore, we have developed many technology to exploring the unseen part of the world even the universe we are not able to reach. For example, we cannot reach to the deepest part of the sea due to the high pressure. Therefore, scientists have invented submarine with self-driving function carrying a ultrasound camera. This helps human can explore the unseen in a safer way. I think creating a new information carriers is a life-long job for us as information engineering students. We need to be curious to the world and find a way to discover them."
33,27,20170325,7,"I think your point on ""changing our life better"" is quite interesting. In Hong Kong, there are limited place so to the high rent. Many young entrepreneurs cannot afford the rent of shop and therefore give up their dreams. However, I think the information era can help the entrepreneurs to escape this difficult circumstance-- open a e-shop. Nowadays, there are many e-shops using social platform to perform their business, clothes, accessories, or even food can be bought on the shop. Nevertheless, some Illustrators or author can use their talents and interest to earn money themselves like ?????? and ?{????. They illustrate pictures and write a story on social platform to earn profit and develop their interest. Moreover, there is some game streamer in the whole world. Many teenagers know them and enjoy watching their stream. In my opinion, the information era creates lots of job opportunities for the teenagers to do what they really want to do and is a place to make their dreams come true."
65,27,20170325,7,"Nice experiment. I appreciate you that you make the matrix factorization in recommendation system yourself. In previous years in University or Secondary school, we only knew how to solve the matrix factorization. However, we don't know the use and the application of the matrix factorization. But now, I can see combining the programming skills and the matrix factorization to undergo a prediction of a movie rating. Using acquainted knowledge and combine it to create a new application is what engineer aiming to do. What an amazing job! Moreover, the steps are very clear and easy to follow. I must follow the instruction and try out myself. Thanks for your recommendation!"
65,27,20170325,7,"I totally agree the difficulties of sentiment analysis. Besides those pre-processing steps needed to be worried, the ""positive"" and ""negative"" meaning of the word cannot considered as word by word. ""However"", ""Yet"" in the opening can totally make the sentences become not the positive and negative. ""Not"" in front of the adjective can inverse the whole feeling of the comments. Therefore, sentiment analysis should be well-trained before using. Otherwise, an inaccurate result will be analyzed. However, we still need the sentiment analysis because just like what you have mentioned, it is applicable in many different areas and helps us know the overall feeling due to a product/service or a things happened."
67,27,20170325,7,"As the machine learning is well-developing, I think AI will benefit lots from the machine learning. In my opinion, AI can apply to more and more situations. It definitely facilitate our human life. For example, AI can work in some dangerous condition (lava, deep sea-level or the universe) or perform something need accuracy (Minimally invasive). It make the high-risk situation becomes safer. Moreover, machine learning is well suitable for the communication. If you are interested in machine learning development. You can go to IBM Bluemix and create a conversation machine learning program. It is easy to control by setting the entities,intents and some conditions, then you can test the program. And the most attractive reason is it is free for students ! I am also looking forward to the development of the Machine Learning. It will be good to have a deeper discussion with you in the course."
27,27,20170325,7,"Thanks for your reply! Yes we should be aware when we are using the social media. As you have mentioned, most of the social media website will collect our personal information and provide our interest advertisement. I think this is a little bit horrible that they can know everything we have done in the Internet. Therefore, we should be a smart user. Clear cookies regularly, do not give any personal information to any mistrust website or do it in a secure connection (HTTPS instead of HTTP). Moreover, using smart phone is a big trend nowadays. We should set limited authority to the application to prevent them extract extra data from ourselves."
12,65,20170324,7,"Thank you for your sharing.I agree what you said about information not only can reduce our uncertainties in the daily situations, but also help us to gain knowledge via the process of human cognitive. In my opinion, learning HII could also let us understand how information interacts with machine and human. For example, there are three types of interaction: human-to-human interaction, human-to-machine interaction and machine-to-machine interaction. By knowing this, when we need to come up with an answer, we could try to find out the information through these three areas, not only through human interaction!"
52,65,20170324,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I am also excited in doing the project as well:)Actually, machine learning could be applied in many different areas, not only in semantic analysis. According to https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-possible-applications-of-machine-learning, machine learning could be applied in 1. Face detection2. Face recognition3. Image classification4. Speech recognition5. Google6. Anti-virus7. Anti-spam8. Genetics9. Signal denoising10. Weather forecastFor the number 7, Anti-spam, I have experienced in writing to spam filtering project in the course machine learning. We were given a set of training data including the normal email and the spam email. A set of testing data mixing the normal and spam email is also given. We need to train our own model to filter out the spam in the testing data. We applied some popular machine learning algorithm such as svm regression, random forest, logistic regression and naive Bayes classifier. Finally, we found that the result of random forest is the most accurate!I believe that machine learning could also be applied in much more area. So I am looking forward to seeing the future usage of it."
52,65,20170324,7,"Thank you for your special experience!In my opinion, it also shows that how human interact with information. In the past, human interacts with information by direct chatting or calling. The efficiency of spreading information is low.But with the invention of the Internet (WWW), spreading information becomes much more effective! In addition, it is problematic if the fake news could be spread fast. For example, in the US president election, someone claims that due to the fake news, Donald Trump is being affected. So I believe that how to detect bad news and preventing it from spreading fast is another hot topic in the future."
52,65,20170324,7,"I totally agree what you said about the cruciality of breaking news.In my opinion, there is another problem we need to take care of -- content farm.In recent years, to raise the clicking rates, some media would keep posting any topics, no matter it is important or not. In case the user clicked into it, the media could make profit. It is also bad for the user, because the content of these media is always useless, some of them are even not true. To deal with this, we have to ""block"" those content farm."
6,53,20170325,7,"I agree with your viewpoint that there are so many fake information in the internet. For example, in 2008, somebody said that The Bank of East Asia's financial status was not stable through the internet, after that, many people went to the bank and took money and bank runs occurs. Therefore, we must think carefully before we believe."
6,53,20170325,7,"I really agree with you!!! In nowadays we always use short form to present some vocabularies. Although they are convenient, sometimes they are confusing. We could easily misunderstand the meaning of the sentences."
41,53,20170325,7,"Thanks for sharing. I think that the difficulties in analyzing Chinese is higher than English. Because the language system is more complex. The usage ofTraditional, Simplified or even Chinese in Taiwan varies with each other. We need to pay a more efforts if we want to have accurate sentiment analyze in Chinese Words."
32,53,20170325,7,"I think your viewpoint on ??Songs and music are the ??apps?? ?? is quite interesting. I agree that we use music and songs to interact with each others. Sometimes we have some famous songs to represent a decade.However, is it really 100% a good thing that we use computer to generate music? Of course, we can increase the productivity of the music, especially for the pop songs. But, human cannot be replaced by the computer, we have sentiments, computer can be our tools but not replacing us."
43,53,20170325,7,"Yes ! I agree with you. Social media is just a tool for us to get in touch with our friends. In order to enhance the friendship, we need to chat, to meet and to care. A 'like' or 'follow' is just the first step, we have to do more outside the social media to make real friends."
67,53,20170325,7,"I agree with you. I faced the same situation as u faced before. When I gather with a group of friends, they always look on their own mobile phones, watching on ??Facebook?? or ??Instagram??. Although these apps are called social media, but they destroyed this social events I think that we should control our usage on our phones during social events, we need to respect each other and treasure the time we meet."
75,53,20170325,7,"I agree with that the machine learning is a growing trend in our world. Machine Learning can help us a lot as they can learn themselves and provide results. Also, I strongly agree that u said we should be the controller of the technology. Yes, nowadays many work can be replaced by computer, however we should concern that we need to care about the human force, we need to hire people to let people work and earn income."
69,53,20170325,7,"I agree with that the social networks link the people from the whole world together. We can easily group people with same view or interest together. However, have we ever think of social networks isolate others who are not using them? Nowadays we always use 'Facebook' to express our views, or some people use it to promote their ideas. We form groups in the internet. But, in fact, there are still quite a number of people don't use them. We always think of the comments from the web is the main idea, but we always forget the one who doesn't use it."
3,53,20170325,7,"It is very interesting. Once of the problem in Hong Kong nowadays is the shortage of medical staffs. When we want to see a doctor in the hospital, we need to wait for around 5-6 hours. If we can use this technology, we solve solve the problem in manpower.However, we must be careful because it is related to health and life. We need to ensure that it is nearly 100% safe and accurate before we use it wisely."
3,53,20170325,7,"Interesting! Body languages can also express ones feeling. Other than some specific gestures, our smiles, our eye contact can also express ourself. Therefore, don??t think that no one knows what you think even you are not talking !! Haha"
63,53,20170325,7,"I agree with that we must face huge difficulties in reality on sentiment analysis. I also talked about this in my blog post As a Hong Kong people, I first thought of how can it applied in Chinese. Chinese is a extremely complex language system. Different places have different slangs, but they are all written in the same Chinese Word. How can the computer understand the actual meaning of the sentences? I hope we can see it one day"
51,53,20170325,7,"Agree!! Nowadays we like to use emoji. Once we can??t think of anything to reply, we type emoji. However, have you ever think of emoji is also a kind of language? Emojis are usually facial expression, which is a kind of body language. Body language can also express ourselves. haha"
1,53,20170325,7,"I agree with you! Nowadays we always focus on developing high-tech shops for convenience. These technology mainly target on the youngsters who often use the high-tech gadgets. However, we should also care about the elderly, we should develop some user-friendly things for them. They like to use Nokia more then Iphone! Because Nokia is more simple."
12,53,20170325,7,"I faced the same situation as you! I also wrote a blogpost about the recommendation system. I think this kind of system is quite helpful, because they know our needs and the provide suitable advertisement for us. This can encourage us to spend money and good for the economy."
12,53,20170325,7,"Sure. We need to be smart when we are using social media. We should judge whether the information is true or fake. For example, in 2008, somebody said that The Bank of East Asia??s financial status was not stable through the internet, after that, many people went to the bank and took money and bank runs occurs."
55,53,20170325,7,"I think we need to think about it is really a good thing that machine replace human. For sure, technology provides a lot of convenience in our daily life. However, if we replace human by machine, then what can human do? We need to balance the workforce, we need manpower, we need to let them work in order they can have income. We should treat machine as tools to increase our productivity but not replacing us."
64,40,20170322,7,"Yes, semantic information provides different kind of information to us and therefore we need to make sure the information can be accurately express to the others, for example using some icons that we know what they mean etc. in order to enhance the user experience."
33,40,20170322,7,"Digital information is becoming more and more important in nowadays. As you mentioned, online shop is very popular in this generation. Buyers can just click a button and search for the products they want to buy, they also need not to get the products and take it back home, the online shop will find someone to deliver the product to their home, which is efficient and convenient to buyers though some time is needed to wait the product delivering to their home. Though we cannot read what is the meaning of those 1s and 0s, those information is making our life much better."
43,40,20170322,7,"I agree that social media cannot enhance friendship. For me, social media is a tool to grab information that I want to know about, I seldom watch something that my friend shared though I may have a look if the topic attracts me. Though social media cannot enhance friendship well, it is a convenient way for us get the information we want to know about."
44,40,20170323,7,"I see your point that the smart technology is making our life better, but it is weakening some of the ability that we need to train as well. I agree that the smart technology is weakening our ability in some aspects, for example as you mentioned we may remember less, it is real that the devices like smart phones or tablets have a record about when he/she needs to do something in a certain time. We need not to remember the event that we need to join for a long time, we just need to remember before we type a record in the smart phone and then we need not to remember it after since it will remind us when the event is imminent. However, I do not totally agree the point about the smart technology may let us have less critical thinking which it may enhance our ability of critical thinking. In this information age, we can get information easily but we need to know whether the information is correct or not, which is way to train our skills on critical thinking. Though the smart technology is making our life better, it has some bad influence to us. I hope those problems will be minimized in the future."
52,40,20170322,7,"Semantic information means the symbols that can express some kind of information and language is exactly a kind of symbol (it is just readable by humans) thus language is a part of semantic information but it is not all of it. Semantic information can provide information to us in a short period of time and therefore it is an important way to exchange information.NLP is not that developed in nowadays, time is needed to let the machines ??learn?? more to recognize the opinions written by humans whether they are positive or negative."
10,40,20170323,7,"It is a fact that there are more and more online shops in Hong Kong these days. As you mentioned, the shop owner can face less risk and cost in order to open an online shop while the customers can just have a click and order the products they want and the products may mainly delivered to the home directly. This is a reason that more and more people are willing to start their own business nowadays. Though traditional shops still have their selling point to attract people like they can touch the product and know more about the quality of the products provided, online shops still have a great advantage in convenience and saving physical space."
57,44,20170325,7,"Thanks Jinny! From class and your sharing, I get some idea. Nowadays, we can use our programming skills easily and get some functions, but why we cannot be the famous company CEO, now software engineering is easier so we can copy the idea easily, but what we need is our creativity and the service of human. All the programming can be learnt, but only the useful one can help you be rich even that idea is easy to be done by anyone, for example, create some emoji or put the pictures into emoji. After the idea which can service so many persons, we should keep improving and let your idea service more, for example, even the Facebook company is successful and famous in most countries, but they keep improving and add more functions so that this company can keep the success. Therefore, future is the age urged us more creativity and to think more about the need of our life. I think that is the importance of UI."
19,44,20170324,7,"Thank you for your kindly sharing at first. From the class, I just know that Naive Bayes is an easy way to judge and distribute, but it need us to have special element or circumstance to classify the items or objects. If we cannot consider well we will get the wrong results. Take the example which shown by professor, we identify the apples based on the color is red then the size and the shape. As our first impression, it is very easy to classify the apples, but think it over, we can find that this system also shows peaches, tomatoes and more other kinds of fruit as apples, so I think this method is too inefficiency. Nevertheless, I get new opinion in your post, I realize that all the efficiency methods are found from some the easy or well-use methods. The reasons why that simple methods are used is that it solves some problems. Maybe the new better ways to classifying is discovering from Naive Bayes. Searching this theory, I found that in 2006, we found some more new methods which have higher performance based on Naive Bayes, for example, Random Forests."
19,44,20170324,7,"As you mentioned, different genders have different body language, for example, girls often hand in hand to do somethings together, but for boys, this behavior is strange and they will do this with their friends(boys,is it right?) Furthermore, I also think that different genders for same voice language or words have different idea or thought. even meaning. For example, when girls said ??I am not angry?? pulling long face, it is obvious anger but some boys may think this sentence means ??I am OK??. Let me share some little tragic stories with you. I am usually ??invited?? to listen the couple complain to each other, most reasons are they misunderstand the meaning of others."
19,44,20170325,7,"Thank you for sharing the psychology and these three level of cognition. As you said that this theory can help us learn something deeper. What I think is that why we often said that we can test for our knowledge and forgot it soon is that we just go through 1st level- Cognition and 2nd level- Meta-cognition but without 3rd level-Epistemic Cognition. I can remember that what I learnt in school just because I often think it and use it in our life, but for some courses, I just remember I struggled for it for many nights but I cannot remembered the context of it. That may the other reason why we often encouraged to learn our interesting major is that we will think more and reflect about our interests. Thank you for your sharing!"
19,44,20170325,7,"As I mentioned in my post, I agree that big data is a helpful and awesome technology but it need some limitation and rules. For example, in many films, we can see that some wonderful hackers can control and watch you, check you chatting history and keep an ere for you in any where. In fact, if we know that this skill is used to do something good, we are appreciate for it, but how can we know who are the hackers and what is their purpose?? What??s more? Have you ever watched the film called <>?? Some governments used this technology to control our society, why they cannot tell the citizens? In this case we can see that big data will bring big problems for us so that we need some rules and limitation to use this and the rules cannot easily set by governments or some organizations. Before the setting of the limitation and rules, we should consider the result and influence of some high class technology and keep an eye on it!"
40,44,20170325,7,"From our class about language and body language, we can see that different background or genders or country persons will have different realization for same words or sentences. For example, even in Hong Kong, boys and girls will have different meaning of ??I am OK for the restaurant?? or ??Whatever you want??. It was a heat topic in last few months. Therefore, even our human who lives in same place cannot understand the meaning of same words, how can we teach our computers to do this difficult missions? I think so many boys especially the boyfriends hope some day they can get the translation machine of their girl friends. But someone tried to do this machines though the result of cause ?? From the class about machine learning in our course, we can see that we human have tried so many methods to achieve this goal, and now we can see some little success, for example, supervised learning, linear regression and so on. In my opinion, we are hard to learn the language even machine and human, but we can solve some problems from machine learning. Take my friends?? FYP as an example, they learnt machine learning and learn the AAC for the communication disabled students and then now they build a wonderful function that communication disabled students can use apps to communicate better. From this result, we can help so many people if we use machine learning well, then we can solve more and more the language or communication problems."
40,44,20170325,7,"Thanks Charles and I also get some idea from the comments. Semantic information is important like you all saying. It can help us understand and get information from others. Without semantic, I cannot comment this and get your sharing. I think semantic information will be an element which decide whether the product is successful or not. As I comment in many posts that many successful companies will keep improving and try their best to service more. Thank is the reason why UI is so significant. Without semantic information, how can we get the customers idea, suggestions and feed back? For example, if we do not give course evaluations for our professors or courses, how can all the professors teach us well? By the way, without semantic, how can professors teach us about what they know? As an engineers, we should take care of the need of our customers and use semantic information well to improve the product, the result must encouraged!"
40,44,20170325,7,"Let me share my story about your post about different context. My final year project is now building a function about speech-to-picture, the largest problem we are facing is that same pronunciation may has different words or meanings. Even same words in different situations have different meaning, so it is hard to teach machine to show correct pictures every time. For example, we say??apple??, when we say in canteen, it may mean a kind of fruit, but in lab, it may mean the brand of a company or their products such as iPhone or iPad. Therefore, I cannot agree more that context is a big problem, and learn it well can help us get the correct information, so when we present something or promote some product, we should consider this carefully. After that we should compute more, as you said, users?? convenience and daily lives."
40,44,20170325,7,"As you wrote that information age need us to be careful to collect the right information. Nowadays, we can share and get the events and the feeling easily, but not all the information is right, but when we read the information, we are easily to be influenced by the words, some times it led a terrible situation. For example, we often comments the facebook posts based on the words, we often say something to complain the persons who are shared as a bad persons without criticism. Take the heat topic ??offer seat to the need??, we can see many persons said some offensive language without thinking about if the girls got sick or be disabled so that she was sitting but the older was standing. What is more, without critical thinking, many persons often judge some one based on the words by others without fact, it is unhealthy but a big problem in this information age, especially the big data age is coming."
69,44,20170325,7,"From your kindly sharing, we can see that the Naive Bayes is easy to classify the information, though the method is easy but useful even nowadays. For example, we can classify the email into spam or the important based on Naive Bayes. Although the method has so many limitation and need improvement, for example, it classifies the apples just based on the color, shape and size, but how about the peaches which has similar shape with apples? But all the high class is begin with the simple but useful methods. In fact, in 2006, we get more methods to classify better based on the improvement of Naive Bayes. This story also encourages us to try more even some persons may say yours is too low class or too idiots, who knows yours may be very useful after improvement?"
55,44,20170325,7,"Your post reminds me about the memories about the dictionary, nowadays, technology and science are changing our life fast, but new problems appeared?Cthis age are less human kindness. As you mentioned, teachers can be replaced by computers, but taught by computers only can help us get the information or knowledge but not the pleasure of taught by human teachers. We just struggle for a high efficiency age but not the kindness, human will lose the unique of a person or human. If all the persons are only struggling for money or more knowledge, why we just own a computer but not give birth for a kid? Human is unique not only our ability of thinking but also kindness. As you mentioned, now smart city or smart products are promoted and improved everyday, but we can see that more and more persons lose the meaning of his or herself. I think all the persons especially the software engineers should consider the kindness when we develop our smart future."
21,16,20170324,7,"We all recognize the positive functions of HII in social media such as the mass amount of information, rapid transmission, and worldwide connection. The technology is neutral in nature, it may bring harms or benefits to people depending on the user handling the tools. As a educated student, we must follow the rituals and utilize the technology in good manner with meaningful intention."
21,16,20170324,7,"It is very useful for us if the face recognition tech. become popular, as our faces are unique and it brings a high degree of security. You point out the problem when the face data leak out, and we may be harmed as our face is a kind of personal information. Besides that, there may be a problem of matching as our face is changing from time to time. The matching will someday be inaccurate and cause trouble to the security system."
21,16,20170324,7,"Personally, I strongly admire the attitude and the method of Amazon in tackling the fake comments. We see that the fake comments destroy the effectiveness of the sentiment analysis and it is a kind of abuse. Therefore we can see the users of Amazon recognize the efforts and raise the reputation of the company."
21,16,20170324,7,"The powerful effectiveness of making decisions from the machine is unquestionable. However we should not 100% trust the decision of the machine as it is too objective without any room for correction. For example in moral issue, it is a dilema for machine to have an immoral judement. The results is always for reference only as we human should do the decision with multiple aspects consideration."
75,16,20170324,7,"I agree with your point that engineer should create products that are related to human information interaction because of its increasing importance. I particularly agree with your example that we can extract useful information from contents, which we can obtain information effectively."
75,16,20170324,7,"I strong agree with your view that we are implicitly affected by the social media, especially there are many generated contents recommended that intentionally change your mind. Therefore we should be aware of the contents on net and seek information from more sources to maintain objectiveness and correctness."
75,16,20170324,7,"Besides the casual chatting that expresses emotions between people, there are still functions of sending an objective and concise message through ??language??. That??s why we need to develop scientific language like ??mathematic?? which transmit a message with 100% matching. Therefore we need a balance between using pictures with universal meanings or texts."
75,16,20170324,7,"I see the point of the developing machine learning due to its powerful benefits. However, there are drawbacks if we cannot control the machines. The scientists that develop artificials intelligence should aware the impact. Maybe the horrible scene about outraging machine become true one day, and it is too late we can do nothing to due with it"
29,16,20170324,7,"In the old days, the content of a website cannot be change easily as the contents can only be updated intentionally by the owner of the website. But nowadays, we have websites like Facebook, Wikipedia that we can change its content online. This increase the interaction between people and effectively adapted the advantages of internet. This is important to the rapid development of HII."
29,16,20170324,7,"I agree with you that the interaction between human cannot be easily replaced by the social media, as the comprehensive ways of expressing our emotions are difficult to be transmitted by digital signal. However, with the improvement of the technology, we can have a high degree of conversation simulation, for example with the use of VR and 4D technology. We can see that the technology can reduce the distance between human effectively, regardless of the time and space."
29,16,20170324,7,"The technology of sentiment analysis is helpful in obtaining directional information from comments of different users, which is useful for us to decide the quality of a certain product or service. However, if we strongly rely on it, we may be harmed. If the analysis is wrongly done, we are getting a meaningless conclusion and miss out some good product. An interesting case is the national election of the president in the US recently. We observe the opinion on internet support Hilary mainly, however Trump was elected at the end."
29,16,20170324,7,"Thanks to the advanced technology, we can effectively obtain information from a sea of information. However, we need to trade our privacy and provide our habits and preference to the machines. The huge collection of data from many users from the big data and it become more valuable in this day. As a normal end-user, it is our responsible for recognizing how our information is used and spread, otherwise, we are manipulated by others intentionally."
66,16,20170324,7,"The theory is particularly useful today as we receive a huge amount of data every day. It is difficult for us to digest without effective screening and arrangement. I believe that some popular social media is designed in matching the theory so that the users feel comfortable and effective in gaining information. The theory implicitly applies in our daily life, improving our life."
66,16,20170324,7,"I find the survey results interesting as the top ranks are owned by big brand name and celebrities. People usually seek entertainments from social media and gain contents from generated contents. We see the huge potential in advertising industry that we advertise product or service on the social media, which can be spread rapidly and be received by the users that meet the target."
66,16,20170324,7,"We always receive recommended information from different social media without our cognition. The contents sometimes may be unjustified and biased, this will affect our decision making. We need to develop a sense in judging the information we see, in order to protect ourselves from malicious information."
51,21,20170322,7,"Yes, there is no doubt that this course has a huge difference by comparing other engineering course. It focus more on interactions between human and engineering instead of how human could do to master engineering. It broadens my horizon and I think it's quite important for engineer to put themselves in users' shoes. This could raise quality of product and become more user friendly."
10,21,20170322,7,"The trend of digital environment will be popular in HK for sure. We can see HK??s field of digital payment is becoming more mature, for example Octopus?? P2P payment service, Apple Pay etc. Security approach and technique is raising day by day, it provides secure payment for customers and raise their confidence of online shopping.Also, by using real time chatting system, customers could reach shop assistant for their help all the time. This makes digital shop looks more similar to a physical shop. And may bring better experience for some ??shy"" customers."
47,21,20170322,7,"Machine learning with big data can bring various benefits for sure. As mention in your post, by utilizing big data technology we can mine information from raw data and gain useful information. Using these useful information, business can make decisions easily and with less risk. For example, supermarkets can hold promotions according to customers?? shopping habit in order to attract more customers. These shopping habit could be recognized by data mining from previous record."
55,21,20170322,7,"It??s obvious that lots of systems and applications decided to adopt contextual computing for providing better service, for instance Netflix and Amazon utilize user??s information about hobbies and preference to recommend products, Facebook further analyse users?? social network and ??liked information?? and propose relevant information or advertisements. Personalization brings a better user experience without doubt.However, some critics concern security problem of contextual computing. Extracted information of a user may involve sensitive information. If these information are being stolen and used by law-breakers it would bring serious consequences."
13,21,20170323,7,"I agree that HII is a vital component for information explosion. By studying HII, engineer could understand how users make their decisions and how data are being produced. Other than information explosion, HII is essential for producing a user friendly environment. Engineers understand users' habits thus to produce interface and service to cater users' needs. Satisfying users' need is an important component for a software's success."
2,21,20170323,7,"I would like to give feedback about human interaction problems that you raised in the article. I agree that robots or machines would be more important in future yet it's hard to replace human on the aspect of social interaction. Robots could replace human for accomplishing tasks, as tasks usually have single solution. For example, getting a cup of water, throwing balls, calculating etc. Through various trials of training and learning, robots can perform many tasks like a human do. However, human interaction is a difficult field for robot. It involves many different scenarios and meanings. A sentence implies different meanings in distinct situations. For instance, ""You are very smart!"" could be praising someone or could be mocking. It's hard for machine to learn how the sentence means and give appropriate response. Also, it would be very boring when giving identical response every time."
76,21,20170323,7,"Online shopping can bring lots of benefits without doubt. It could even achieve services that physical shops could not provide. There are lots of software integrating image recognition with online shopping. When user spotted shoes they want to buy on street, they could simply take a photo of shoe and upload it to the software. Software would recommend similar shoes from online shops. It's easy for customers to get their dream shoes.Moreover, there's no more geographical limitation for shopping anymore. Customers could buy products from different countries through online shops. For example, Hong Kong people like buying cosmetic products from Japan. They could only ask friends to help them buy in Japan before, but now they could buy them from Rakuten Market directly."
43,21,20170323,7,"I think social Media would not be a tool for enhancing friendship. We could utilize it to receive information from friends. Reading their thoughts or photos. Yet receiving information or giving ""likes"" to them would not enhance relationship for sure. Deep conversations or connections are keys for enhancing friendship and they could not be conducted on social media. If we want to be closer with our friends, we should find them by private chatting tools like Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp and ask them to hang out."
69,21,20170323,7,"I agree the influence of social network is huge. I would say it is linking whole world up. It enables interactions between people from distinct countries. Like the comment and reply function of Facebook, it allows users to express their opinion and give feedback to others' comment at the same time. It's easy for users to make new friends. Moreover, social network allows real time information exchange. When media is being uploaded to social media, they could be shared and seen by every users on the platform. Information is being transmitted in high speed with huge area. Yet social media create distances between human at the same time. There are lots of phubbers recently. Phubbers refers to those who keep looking at their phone in a social setting. We should interact with others face- to- face in these gatherings. However, the ones who addicted to Social Media kept paying attention on their phone. And we can see social Media becomes a barrier for human interaction in this case."
62,21,20170323,7,"Yes I agree that HII would be a new field that engineers have to study. Engineers construct products for customers. It's important to understand relationships between machine and human. And build systems according to HII studies for creating a more user-friendly platform for users. Moreover, machines and systems tends to be more personalized, for catering specific needs for every individuals. Through studying individual's hobbies and interest to recommend information or service to them. These are functioning based on HII."
23,21,20170324,7,"Human Information Interaction is an important study area for Engineering Student. Engineering student learn professional principals and skills of building systems. HII provide ideas for Engineers to build systems that can bring greater experience to end users. Recognizing needs of users can create services and interface that can cater their needs. Furthermore, lots of end users don't have professional knowledge like Engineers do, it's important to put ourselves in end users' shoe to create a user- friendly systems. A user- friendly system is always more welcomed by users."
9,21,20170324,7,"Someone say the future trend of IT industry would be Artificial Intelligence. It is intelligence performed by Machine. To conduct machine learning, we have to insert data and corresponding labels to train the machine. These data have to be ""translated"" to digital form like what you mentioned in the blog. For instance, digital image would be represented in matrix or numbers. Through image feature extraction method like CNN, a model can learn an image in digital way. And CNN is acting as a translator in this case."
40,21,20170324,7,"Sentiment analysis is important and useful to understand opinions and make decisions. Yet I think it requires various, multiple and on-going trainings for machine to learn meaning of these sentences. Language has loads of variations, there are many expressions for the same meaning. For example, for the case we feel sad, we can say, ""I feel unhappy."", ""I am feeling blue."" Moreover, slangs, wordings that could only be understood by particular groups of people, would raise difficulty for machine to decide the real meaning of sentiment. It's quite difficult to produce an error-free machine."
33,52,20170324,7,"It is real that digital information is crucial nowadays. Technology is actually changing our lifestyle, one of the example is that online shopping is becoming more and more popular. maybe our lifestyle may soon be changed when some other new technologies are developed. And importantly, most of the new technologies developed in these days are all related to digital information. That??s why it is always real that digital information is vital and is always making impact to us."
33,52,20170324,7,"VR is really an interesting and crucial topic nowadays. It do can help the people to do something which they cannot do in the real situation. It can also bring us lot of interesting experiences. However, it is also concerned that people may be addicted to this technology and make them become lazy or unrealistic."
33,52,20170324,7,"It is true that HII is important to us as engineering students, at the same time HII is also important to every single person in the world. Every people on the world can also share their knowledge or technologies to others through internet, so that people form different places, different culture can improve themselves by acquiring knowledge from the internet. That??s why it is important for us to understand how the interactions are done."
19,52,20170324,7,"Language is always one of the most fantastic and wonderful things in the world. There are more than hundreds spoken language language in the world, and then body language can be treated as one of the languages, then now, emoji is invented and it can also be treated as a language. It may not be really hard for machine to analyse the meaning of emoji or spoken and written language, but if the machines could even accurately analyse the human body language, it would just be freaking awesome.I just can??t imagine what kind of new languages can be invented in the future along with the technology development."
19,52,20170324,7,"It is real that sometime it is hard to find the correct information from the internet and it is quite true and interesting to say the big data is too big. In this modern era, as it is too easy for us to share our information or find information through internet. It is not weird that we will find some incorrect or useless information from the internet, that??s why it is important to think twice before we decide to use the information we found, and it is also why HII is quite an interesting topic which is worth one semester to understanding it."
27,52,20170324,7,"Social recommendation is not a bad stuff originally. However, some companies and restaurant may make use of it to make profits. Some companies or restaurants may hire someone to give recommendation which are not real or fake about their own companies so they can attract customers and make profit form it. That??s why it is important for us to learn how to distinguish which opinion is correct or not, and that??s the importance of understanding HII."
22,52,20170324,7,"Firstly, I love your boxing cover photo. It is true that we can find better ways to improve our current information system and service or even advance AI by understanding HII. Also, as the influence of Information and the spreading speed of information are quite amazing nowadays, it is quite important for us to understand HII deeply. This course has given me clear ideas about HII and I hope you also have enjoyed the classes."
56,52,20170324,7,"It is a quite nice review of some greatest social media platforms in the world nowadays. I believe the popularity of different social media platform in different places depends on the habit and culture of the places. Facebook and Instagram, and snapchat for youngsters are likely the most popular platform in Hong Kong. However, Twitter is one of the most popular platform in Japan and Europe. I can??t say which of them is the best, I believe each of them have their strength and can cater to different people with different culture.Social media is one of the biggest platform to spread information in the world now and I believe it will last for quite a long time before some other new and innovative technologies are suggested."
27,52,20170324,7,It is real that sentiment analysis is an interesting and useful technique. We can use this technique to analyse the overview of the opinions from human so we can briefly understand the others?? opinions at first sight which can make our life much easier. I really hope that one day i can see the sentiment analysis technique is fully developed and I can benefit from it.
68,52,20170324,7,"Machine learning has always been an interesting and crucial topic in technology industry. It is great that if machine learning can do prediction to make our life better and easier. Also, it would also be great that if the machine can understand human??s mind and emotion. I do hope machine learning can be developed greatly and make our life much easier and more efficient."
38,52,20170324,7,"It is a nice case studying. You explained how the Netflix recommendation system works clearly, which helps me to understand the basic flow of the training system. Your concerns about the underlying error is also quite reasonable. Recommendation system is quite an interesting technique nowadays and I do really hope it will be more perfect in the future as it does benefit us."
43,52,20170324,7,"I think social media does have its own way to enhance friendship. Using social media is just one of many ways to contact our friends. Using social media to read or give likes to the news feed of our friends are kinds of contacting our friends which can help us to maintain our friendship and have some updates about our friends. It is a good way for to keep in touch with friends when we are not free to have a face-to-face meeting. Though using social media is not the best way to enhance friendship but I do think social media has its ability to enhance friendship if we can make good use of it. I believe the best way of enhancing friendship is to have face-to-face activities with your friends, so don??t just sit in front of your laptop and give likes through Facebook, it does not help, let??s go find your friends this weekend."
33,52,20170324,7,"I agree that information is one of the main element to affect the social behavior. People decisions are always affected by others?? opinions. In this modern era, information can be spread easily and quickly, it is important to develop our critical thinking ability so that we will not be affected easily and we can have our own mind"
27,52,20170324,7,I do like your points of view. HII is always happening every second and everywhere which makes our life more efficient. We can always find solutions through internet when we have problems. It is great that we can have a deeper understanding of HII by taking this course. I just can??t wait to know more about it and I hope you have also enjoyed the course.
35,52,20170324,7,"Information and how to transfer the information are always the big topics nowadays. As an engineering student, it is important that we should at least have a basic understanding of them. Also, knowing the tendency and the phenomenon of how the information is transferred is quite interesting. This IERG3320 course has given us a clear explanation of HII, how the human interact with human through machine, how the human interact with machine etc, which are all interesting. Hope you have enjoyed this course."
52,52,20170324,7,"Thank you for your reply. After almost 3 months of attending IERG3320, we have already acquired lots of knowledge of HII and I think we now do have an ability to distinguish the correctness of the information that we have obtained. Furthermore, this course has given us lots of knowledge in different area at the same time which are also interesting. Hope you have also enjoyed this course."
12,64,20170324,7,"Yeah, machine learning is playing an important role in this electronic era.With machine learning, robots can get their vision ?C computer vision. They can classify what they are capturing on the camera. This is compulsory for the household robot. They can classify the new things by their learning.Hoping machine learning can be popular and everyone can get benefit from it."
28,64,20170323,7,"Technology really make our life easier. Although you mention that some of the job are replaced by new technology, some new jobs are created. Such as engineering that study neural networks and AI technology. Maybe the world need less workers that doing repeating jobs and those worker can have more time to learn the things they are interested in. They can get more information by quitting those boring jobs."
1,64,20170322,7,"I think that the payment method of Amazon go is really cool. It saves many time for us as we don??t need to queuing anymore.However, your point of view is also a problem for us to concern about. Maybe we still need to set up some traditional payment counter for the elderly. The Parknshop at CU offer self payment counter that using octopus but there are still traditional payment counters. I think that we need to keep the traditional way before most of the people can adapt to the new payment method."
37,64,20170323,7,"It is hard for computer to learn what is emotion and preferences. What can a computer do is just turning all the things into data and using some mathematics models to compute it. Human usually making decision because of the past experience and sometimes intuition. Computer cannot mime this kind of action.However, when some task that require high level of logic thinking. AI computer can perform better. AlphaGo show that machine learning can beat a experienced chess player."
69,64,20170325,7,"Social network is really powerful and we can knows the news and points of view of others easily even we don??t know each others in the real world. We can gain so much information from social networks.Social networking sites also makes the human ??closer??. By the research of Facebook, the degree of separation is 3.57 instead of 6 now. We connect with more people and communicating with people on the other countries is not that difficult now."
3,64,20170325,7,"I agree with you that companies can get profit by analyzing user??s information. As a companies, we always want to maximize our profit. However, as a end user, we usually do not want the others collect our information without any choices or notification. I think that a company should give choices to user whether they want to give their information to the company or not. This can help the company build a positive image and maybe the user can feel much comfortable when they are using the service."
74,64,20170325,7,"Yeah. HII is important to an engineer. As our inventions or developed software are always used by human, we need to know what are their feelings and opinion. By using sentiment analysis and social network analysis, we can know what is the trend and user??s opinion. We can better improving our inventions.However, we should not take unnecessary or private information from user. As an engineering, our integrity and image are important too as we are professionals.."
44,64,20170325,7,"I agree that UX design is important for an app. No matter how good you program is ( using new technique or using less memory) , if the users find that it is difficult for them to use the app, they will just give up and delete your app. The strength of your apps cannot discovers by user without professional knowledge. Therefore, we need to know how users thinks. Sentiment analysis is a good way for us to analyzing their thought and improve our apps."
23,64,20170325,7,"True. When we develop a software. Getting user??s attention is always the final goal. If they are no user, it is useless no matter how good our programming skill is. Therefore, Human Information Interaction is important for us to study. We can understand our user better by analyzing their information to improve our software."
53,64,20170324,7,"Yeah, analyzing Cantonese is so complicated. Breakpoints of sentence can affect the meaning of what we get. As,?{???????w?F????????. This sentence have two ways to break. I wonder how can computer get the correct meaning of the sentence."
17,64,20170325,7,"I agree your views that what make social networking sites success.Besides, I think one more important point that making them success which is ??innovation??. In this information era. You always get benefit if you have a new thought before others. Google developed their own social networking site ?C Google +. However, they are not many user. It is because Facebook and Twitter are developed before it. When a user is using Facebook, they are less likely to use others social networking sites as their friend are also stable user of Facebook.Therefore, as an engineer, we need to be innovative."
67,63,20170322,7,"This is a good question for us to think about the impact of technologies on Interpersonal relationship. It is no doubt that technologies make us connect with other people around the world easily and we can now communicate with them across time and space. But, does it really improve the relationship between people? Let??s use Facebook as an example, you may have many ??friends?? on your social networking site but are they all your real friends? Also, if we want to analyse the interpersonal relationship of a person, there are many other factors that we need to consider in order to find out the actual relationship. These factors will become barriers to developers to create an accurate system to analyse the information related to human relationship."
27,63,20170322,7,"Recommendation system is a part of the filtering system which wants to help user to find out somethings that they may be interested in. The accuracy of the information is greatly affected the performance of the recommendation system which use collaborative filtering approach since it will analyze users?? behavior to provide recommended items to a user. If the ratings given by other users are faked, it will result in unexpected behavior. Unfortunately, it is hard for computer to detect whether the information is correct or not. As a user, we should be aware to the accuracy of the information on the Internet. Also, it is a good way for the website to check the content of ratings and comments manually before posting it."
3,63,20170322,7,"Body language is important in our life as it can express our feelings or views toward a person or a thing. For example, raise your thumb means that someone did a great job or praising someone. We can understand it because there has semantic convention between the gesture and the meaning. In the above post, we know that body language may have different meaning in different places. This makes me think about how to better design a system to understand and analyze semantic information as I did aware about the impact on the information given due to the culture difference. Thank you for your sharing and I think you have mentioned an important point for developers to design their program."
65,63,20170322,7,Thank for your demonstration on recommendation system using python and it makes me understand more about how to analyze the information with programming. It is good for us to have a practice ourselves in order to understand how the equation taught in the lecture is actually work. I think it will be better for us to understand the recommendation system if you can demonstrate how the parameters affect the result of predicted user??s rating. I think your post will benefit me as help me to understand how to use python to perform analysis on information especially for the coming project.
55,63,20170323,7,"It is obvious that technologies benefit a lot on education such as interaction between students and teachers, and online resources. People keep using different new technologies on education to provide better learning experience to students. For example, people are trying to use VR technique to simulate the situation of a surgery to let medical students learn how to become a doctor. This sounds really fantastic as there is limited chance for medical students to have first-hand experience. I believe that such application on learning will be more and more common in the future and the learning way of students will definitely change."
54,63,20170323,7,"Nowadays, many peoples enjoy using social media to communicate with other peoples and it help increasing interaction between peoples even with different ages. Our former financial secretary, John Tsang, always use his Facebook and Instagram to interact with peoples on the Internet and that is one of the reason why he is more popular among Hong Kong citizen. But I think the effectiveness of social networking depends on how people use it. Face-to-face interaction is still important for interpersonal interaction. If we only force on social networking, it may become a barrier for us to communicate with other people in our daily life. Thanks for your sharing."
45,63,20170324,7,"Thank you for your sharing about Internet of Things. Nowadays, more and more products are integrated with such technologies to provide better experience to their users. Information exchange between devices is the major factor to make things ??smart?? as the program needs to collect user information or activities to provide specific service to the users. This raises a concern of information security as users do not know what kind of data is being collected. Also, how the companies used such data should be supervised to ensure that they will not sell such sensitive data to make profit."
26,63,20170324,7,"Yes, I remember that the first social media site I used is Facebook. At that time, my friends asked whether I have an account of Facebook or not and so I registered to interact with them online. I was addicted to it as people kept discussing about the things in the social networking site. And I believe that more of us sign up their account because of similar reason. ??The Herd Effect?? has great impact to the human society as it can create a trend among people but we also need to be aware of the actual meaning of the thing."
65,63,20170324,7,Thank you for your giving supplementary information and example on supervised learning. Your example is very clear and this give me a concept of how the machine learning works to be used to predict or analyze the new information. I think that it would be better if you can show the accuracy of this type of supervised learning as we know that the performance of the machine learning greatly related to the learning way of the machine. We hope to know more about the factors that affect the performance of the method in order to avoid error in real situation.
51,63,20170324,7,"I think that emoji create a new form of communicate and it also help to express our feeling in more direct way. I agree that language ability is important for us to communicate with people and we need to put more effort on it. Practice is necessary for us to learn a language. However, there is limited chance for us to use other languages to communicate with other causing weakness in language ability. Emoji will not replace language vice versa and it is more important to improve students language ability through education."
28,63,20170324,7,"Thank you for your sharing. Nowadays, our daily life is full of different kind of information and that??s why we need to learn how to analyze and make use of such data to enhance our quality of life. In the past few decades, technologies make human work more efficient and many people think that machine will replace worker one day. I think this is the future trend as we know that machine are more human-like for example AphlaGo, a computer program to play Go, defeated South Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol. I believe that technologies will make people a better life."
61,63,20170324,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I think the theory greatly impact the digital world nowadays as there are many information being transmitted every day. Also, it has a strong relationship with machine learning as we want to use it to help analyzing information automatically. So, we need to teach the machine on how to process the information and let them learn. We know that the size of information become bigger as big data and an efficient algorithm is needed to solve such information. That??s why we need to understand the nature of information and how we can figure out the message that we needed."
46,41,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I think that your example is controversial. I just wonder why you believed that it is done by China but not the United States. Here I think a better way to improve your example. There was an unofficial online referendum organized. The environment was the chaotic situation of Umbrella Revolution, the agent was the public, the understanding was the civil organization would like to show public opinion on the Election of Chief Executive towards the Hong Kong government. And the critical structure was the unofficial online referendum.In the next part, I agree that technology changes rapidly. 10 years before, there was no smartphone. People on train will usually listen to music, read books. But nowadays, people usually used mobile phone when they are on train. Not only technology changes, our behavior also changes accordingly."
59,41,20170323,7,"I love your example so much. That is ??if Gakki is married tomorrow, please send me an email??. I think that if Gakki is gonna to marry, you will know that soon because this news shall be spread out in social media network. I would like to share another intellectual human agent to you in exchange.The intellectual human agent is called Siri, which is per-installed in the iPhone. I usually ask Siri what the temperature is. And as you know, we usually have many applications installed, we may somehow take time to find an application that we seldom use. In such a case, I will tell Siri, ??Help me to open XXX?? (XXX refers to the name of the application). Also, when I want to go somewhere that I have never gone, I will also ask Siri ??Navigate me to XXX?? (XXX now refers to the place that I would like to go).By the way, I love your wallpaper. And I got 4 Yamato but not even 1 Musashi >.< Do you have any solid formula for building Musashi?"
41,41,20170324,7,"Yes. Some of them put a hashtag #HS, while some of them may not post a tag but the post is related to hearthstone. For the first case, I think what we can do is to find out the Synonyms of #Hearthstone and extract them also. But there is a case that the synonyms we collected may not actually refer to hearthstone. For example, #HS can mean HighSchool.For the second case, I think we cannot improve it, as it required extraction of all twit and then let the program to determine if the content related to hearthstone and then it will be heavy.So I think only collect the twit with hashtag #hearthstone is the simple way and it is enough for us to analyse."
24,28,20170323,7,"Thanks for sharing. I think the match between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol is a milestone for the development of machine learning. The match implies that machine is going to breakthrough human being. Machine has,theoretically, no upper limit."
25,28,20170323,7,"Thanks for sharing. Nowadays, VR is quite important technology in any fields. For instance, in psychological therapy, there is a new method to cure PTSD, which uses VR to simulates an virtual things or environment to help the patients to overcome the barrier."
64,28,20170323,7,"Can??t agree more. Especially under the free flow of information nowadays, people tends to believe the information directly instead of interpret it by themselves, since they are trying to follow the mainstream."
29,28,20170323,7,"I agree with you. In the era of information flooding, we have to dig deeply into the data and analysis data wisely. Just like the example mentioned, Obama and his team use sentiment analysis in order to have a better look of the society and public opinion. Which means that sentiment analysis can help us know more about the whole world."
37,28,20170323,7,"This is an interesting analysis on human vs computers. Human distinguish things by their colors, shapes, etc; however, in computers, a picture is only made of a lot of codes. I am taking a course about image processing, it gives me a whole new image of how a computer recognizes a picture and how can I edit a picture with the use of Matlab. The course is worth to take and you can learn more about image processing."
57,28,20170324,7,"Somehow agree that social media is a tool that can help us improve the quality of our lives. It actually helps with people interact through the online platform and may help building better relationships. However, I have a big concern about the privacy problem due to the convenience of social media. Many cases of cyber bullying are in relation to data snooping, and I believe it is because of the openness of social media. Therefore social media might help us improve the quality of lives, but it??s still a risky tool."
45,28,20170324,7,"Thanks for your sharing. I believe that IoT can help people a lot in daily life. For instance, Starbucks published a new app for customers to order drinks remotely. This is a very convenient way for us to order food or drinks in restaurants as it is not necessary for us to queue at the restaurants. This can relieve the workload of the staff too because customers may pay the fee by credit card while they are placing an order."
41,28,20170324,7,"Thank you for sharing. The examples you provided are very interesting and I think even human can??t interpret the accurate meanings of others when talking face-to-face. Since people express themselves in different ways and they are all having different perception, the intended meanings and perceived meanings can??t be actually the same. And I believe this is a timeless limitation for Sentimental Analysis."
62,28,20170324,7,"Thanks for sharing. Undoubtedly, 'trending topics' benefits users because users can see things they like more frequently on their news feed. However, in other words, this may breach users' privacy and make the users get false news."
76,28,20170324,7,"To a large extent, I agree with you. Regard of the sky-rocketed rents in Hong Kong, running an online shop is much easier than running a real shop. Plus, the cost of advertising a shop on Internet is much lower which makes the shop can reach more people. However, customers should pay more attention to the credibility of online shops since there are so much fraud nowadays."
37,5,20170323,7,"I love your example illustrated in your article, this explains me the concept of semantic information clearly. Words are important to everyone, cause this is how we communicate with each others. However, different people has different understanding in different languages. Maybe some of us are well and fluent language users in English and Chinese, some of us are not. This will make the distinguish between people, which different interpretation in the same comment, article or communication. And this is the basic foundation how we raise others?? attention, interpret a topic differently."
71,5,20170323,7,"To make use our public resources effectively, education could only meet for the demand of the man power supply chain market, this is the global trend and situation of our education system nowadays. I believe a good education should tailor made or modified for every single students. No matter she or he has any mentally or physically disable. Perhaps our education should improve and reform. VR education maybe helps to improve student who requires special needs."
71,5,20170323,7,"Words are always hiding behind meanings under context. Sometimes, words are using to conceal its real meaning under the conversation. Computer cannot decide the intonation of the words unless people saying directly. ""I am fine"" , it doesn't really mean that I am fine. That's what I want to express."
70,5,20170323,7,"This post is such an interesting post. Telling how people using ""icon"" to express the function rather than using words with content directly. It reduce the chances for making user confusing and feeling difficulty while using the function. This article really helps designer to design User Interface for any application."
70,5,20170323,7,"Human Robots reaction is a good start for engineers to design a simple analytical algorithm to figure out people decisions. However, people interaction are consists of different aspects and its complexity are extremely high. I will put a question on that is AI good enough to analyze human meanings and emotion correctly through any kinds of context."
70,5,20170323,7,This is a good way to make a good start for a company doing their marketing. Contextual computing could directly point out the favour of their customers or clients. This shows what things are in demand so that the company could adjust and allocate in order to fit for the market.
70,5,20170323,7,I also feeling difficult when I start to write my blog. And I agree that this course has totally inspired my view and knowledge in social media. It taught me how to censor out effective information and how can we make use of it. Information Seeking happens all around us. I hope one day we could make use of social media and benefit our society.
46,5,20170323,7,"It is good hear that you have learnt different knowledge from different profession in Information Engineering. You have clearly demonstrated the concepts of clustering, Cosine Similarity and supervised learning. From your article, I can clarify and understand the above concepts. This is really helpful, thank you."
46,5,20170323,7,"When we talk about information environment, it reflects me think about the election of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive. One of the candidates, John Tsang, has perfectly demonstrated how to make use of social media. He has totally dominated in people satisfaction in this week. His election team are well trained in observing environment and generate the right information to the public. This makes him have great benefit than the two other competitors. And it reminds what this course has taught me through the notes and lectures."
36,36,20170324,7,"Thanks for your reply. I agree with you that amazon go become popular will make lots of people lose their job. But in my opinion, amazon go should have some trail version in Hong Kong and bring more popular in Hong Kong in the future. It is because amazon go is a great purchase system for both seller and buyer, It bring our city more civilized and also it bring a higher quality for citizens. For those people work in supermarket, there are still room for them to work in amazon go. As nowadays, there are lots of hand-made food inside supermarket, for example, sushi and bread can be hand-made by them to control the good food quality. Also, there also have a need for supermarket to invite people for refilling inventory and design some strategy for selling all item."
67,36,20170324,7,"I share the same feeling that you said ??Even a group of friends are sitting in the same dining table, they would not always talk and usually send messages with their iPhones."" I really agree with you that we should pay more attention to the friends and family besides us. We should not rely on social media to release our feeling but try to express ourself by talking to each other."
36,36,20170324,7,"I agree with you that machine learning will be replace some low academic level workers. But there are still some chance for workers because lots of hand-made product are more detail than a well-programmed machine. Also, if machine learning is the way to go, government should give more training for them to involve in the society."
36,36,20170324,7,"With a enough amount of data sample, machine can be more perfect machine. However, I really agree with you that human can be use our creativity to show the value of us that cannot be replaced by robots.Every company need to deal with multiple problems everyday, which is complicated. Robot are not easily tackle the problem because every situation have a great different with a vary environment. However, people can communicate with each other with a creative mind so that they are able to tackle the obstacle with a new specific solution."
68,36,20170324,7,"I really agree with you that It is beautiful when machining learning can contribute to our society. However, machining learning may also bring lots of problems to our society. For example, with a enough amount of data sample, machine can be more perfect machine and replace people??s working opportunity, do you think so?"
68,36,20170324,7,"Thanks for your sharing. I agree with you VR is being popular nowadays. People can create what they like or even what can??t be happened in reality. To me, Virtual reality give a real situation for player which bring a tension for player to stick to the game feeling like the game character.I hope that this VR can be apply to some teaching system which can give student more fun and interactive way for students, do you think it is a good idea?"
29,36,20170324,7,I really agree with you that digital information transforms our environment and living style. Lots of on-screen places for shopping are very popular instead of traditional stores. Do you think that there are no room for traditional to survive when the Information technology be more and more popular?
33,36,20170324,7,"I agree with you that social media brings us a lot of advantages in communication, some essential components of human interaction are unable to provide. I share the same feeling becuase even a group of friends are sitting in the same dining table, they would not always talk and usually send messages with their phones. Do you think that we should pay more attention to the friends and family besides us. We should not rely on social media to release our feeling but try to express ourself by talking to each other?"
1,36,20170324,7,Thanks for your sharing. I agree with you that lots of elderly people are not able to use this system in amazon go because they are not easily to adapt new concept for shopping.

Do you think that it is a bad trend for social media?"
10,36,20170324,7,Thanks for your sharing. I agree with you that The traditional in-store environment are not good enough for against the online store. Online store can reduce the fixed price and decrease the inventory price for buyers which is very important for buyers to decide for buying the product. Amazon Go may be a way to reduce some human resource but also act as a in-store environment for buyer to reduce the fixed cost for seller.

Information seeking strategies today are not only easily than the pass, but also will provide information we may want to know before we actually search for it.

For example, thinking a product that have good UI/UX design, excellent functions and ideas, it must be able to attract many users and earn money.Therefore, I think developers or designers have to think about the user satisfaction of their products before releasing it to the market. It will definitely help their products to have longer life cycle in the market."

I agree that better UX design will definitely improve the product to one more level. Just like the tomato ketchup source example as you mentioned, it will make more convenience to users by applying the UX design to the product. However, designers should keep in mind that to apply suitable UX design in the product while not directly apply every concepts. Therefore, with a good and proper UX design, the product will become more user-friendly."

Therefore, I believe that VR technology can be used to combine with other technologies to provide more benefits to us."
67,29,20170325,7,"I believed that innovation in technology can contribute to human relation if we can use it well. For example, some may claim that Facebook let us making more and more friends in internet, but at the same time lessen the time we communicate with them in real world, as a result getting farther with our friend. This is the case we use it badly. In fact, if we consider social media only as an additional tools, which means we will keep in contact with our friends in real world, at the same time using social media to keep in touch with them in other time, it can help in our relationship. It is the same case as you mentioned, we can use mobile phone to contact other easily, but we should pay attention when should we use it. When we are in an occasion that need to communicate with other, we should put away our phone. In short. I believed that media can helping us to enclose to each other, but depends on how we use it."
36,29,20170325,7,"In my opinion I believed that innovation in robot and AI will replace a lot of job that are currently carried out by human, but it will not replace all of the working position of human in future. Because I when jobs are replaced due to advance in technology, new job will be created. For example, a lot of document processing job, like handling a lots of data is done by human in the pass and it is now replaced by computer. However, as we created computer, there are a lots of new jobs created like hardware or software developer. And actually advancing in technology is helping us to improve our working environment and quality. Computer or robot replaced a lot of exhausting labor job, and human are able to do other easier or more innovative jobs in a comfort environment. So I don't agree that robot will replace human."
51,29,20170325,7,"I my opinion I don??t think that people using emoji or informal language in social media platforms will weaken their language. Because for each student in Hong Kong they are required to learn formal language at least in kindergarten, primary school and secondary school, and I believe that it is sufficient to ensure they have sufficient language ability for daily requirement. Besides, when people are communicate outside social media, like school or work place that are actually need to use formal language, so there are a lot of chance for them to use. Moreover, emoji or informal language used in social media are sometime allowed people to express their feeling in a convenient way, just think of every time you need to write a lots of words to express your happiness instead of simply using a smile emoji. So I believed that emoji are kind of tools to enhance communication between people, but not affecting their language ability."
75,29,20170325,7,"In my opinion, i think that human have limited ability when doing different tasks and for a long time we rely on tools to helping us to complete task that are unable to achieved by human. For example, human are unable to cross the ocean by swimming themselves, so we built ship for long distance travelling in water. And today when we are require to analysis massive of data and executing calculation in no time, we rely on computer. So machine learning is the same thing, it help us to process uncountable data on internet and analysis user??s behaviour quickly, which are impossible to achieved by human. Therefore, machine learning is a another great tool created by human. All of the inventions mentioned above are have higher ability in different aspect than human, but it is not meaning human is loser, In fact, they help to improve our life quality instead. I believed that since we are the creator of all the inventions, we have the final control over all of them, so we will always be the beneficiaries with the aid of advance in technology."
37,29,20170325,7,"In my opinion, raise of social media have already changed the way we communicate and the flow of information. For example, in the past pass people can only acquire daily information through news or newspaper, which is unidirectional and inefficient way. People are hard to gain instant information of what is happening in the world, also there are only limited ways when people have incidents that want to announce others at that time. However, nowadays people are able to access incidents happening in the world in no time through social media, also people are able to announce other what is happening on them in the same manner. So I think raise o social media are contributing on human??s communication."
21,29,20170325,7,"I agree that Amazon doing well in building confidence of client toward their platform. It is important that customer can view the truthful comment about products in an online transaction platform. Because different from a real stop, customer are unable to touch or view the real product online, how they can determine a product is only through the comments from other user. So fake review will cause unsatisfactory of customer who have purchase product from the platform, as they do not get the product they really want. Therefore by banning fake account and ranking of user can help to build up customer's confident, and result in more profit of Amazon."
21,29,20170325,7,"I agree that social media have both advantages and disadvantages toward people, and it is just depends on how people use it. Advantage of social media is obvious, we can access information all over the world instantly and conveniently, also we can meet people from different place. However, what we said in the internet is not under controlled, any one can say anythings in it without responsibility. And the main user of social media like Facebook are come from country that have freedom of speech, so censorship is not possible. Therefore, it is important for us to justify truthiness of content in it. Also government can take the role of education people of not posting fake information on internet and teach them how to justify the information."
68,29,20170325,7,"I agree that machine learning can optimise human life. Computer now are capable to store and analysis massive of data in a short time, different from human which may require a lots of man power and time to achieve the same task. Besides of prediction as mentioned from you, machine learning can also uncover hidden insight from historical relationship and trend of data, which is good for engineer or analysts to obtain possible risk that are now easy to notice by human. So the development in machine learning can surely contribute to our society."
39,29,20170325,7,"You have a clear definition of what is online information artifacts. And I think that social media enhanced the spread of online information artifacts is not only by many information people can access and able to share it easily, but also of the diversity of the information. In physical information artiacts like book, information can only in form of word and pictures. However, for those information in internet, they can in various forms, like sound , video and virtual reality. People are able to access information in diversify forms, which made human cognition of information more efficient."
8,29,20170325,7,"I think it is hard to compare cognitive process between human and machine, since they both have their advantage in different aspects. For human learning, we can gain information by just look to an object directly, so we are able to understand abstract ideas and their meanings. And for machine, we have to convert it into digital information first before it start to learn about a thing. It maybe poorer for machine to understand meaning of an object, but it have an ability of processing massive information a the same time while human can't. So I think that we probably cannot compare human and machine cognitive process, but regarding machine as a tool for us to gain information."
10,29,20170325,7,"I agree that online shopping is a new trend of people purchasing habit, because of it's convenience. People can now easily to browse different kinds of stores and buy the things they want by sitting in front of a computer. However, I think that online shop can never replace a real shop. Customer can never get a full understanding of the product they want to buy in the internet, because they can only know the detail and quality of product only by description and photo provided by retailer, also by the comment of customer. While shopping in a real store, customer are able to view and touch the real product, which providing them highly confidence that online shop can never provide."
44,29,20170325,7,"In my opinion, I don't think that advancing of digital information will causing too much bad effect on people. First of all, for the memory part, it is true that people rely on computer to saving staff, but is it really cause by the occurrence of computer? In fact, before computer people use note book to write down the things they what to memory, computer is just another tool for us to saving things efficiently. Beside, with computer help us in saving and processing data quickly, we are now able to doing other advancing things. For example, people in the pass in to spend a lot of time for simple mathematics calculation when doing research, and now since computer have carry out the calculations, we are able to focus on the research aspect. Moreover, for the critical thinking aspect, it is true that we are now able to access many kinds of information easily, but the sense of justification truthiness of information is not affected by the quantity of information we have received, it is depends on our education and life experience. So I believed that advancing in digital information will not affect our thinking."
28,29,20170325,7,"I agree that advancing in communication tool have made use communicate with other easily and efficiently. In the past, people can only communicate with other using speech or words and it is also hard to contact people who are from from us. This kind of communication is inconvenient and some time it is hard to describe somethings only by words. By the advancing in communication tool, we are now able to communicate with anyone in no time, also with aid of picture and video, we can express ourselves more efficiently and accurately."
25,29,20170325,7,"With the advancing of digital information, we are able to acquire information in various forms and I agree that VR is a new technology that allow us to have a better experience of information. Because it can simulate a environment for user and made him have a thorough understanding of it. And I think in the future communication tool can able to provide more sense, like smelling and touching, so that human cognition of information can be better."
53,29,20170325,7,"I believed that recommendation have brings us a lots of benefits. As you mention, the system may provide somethings we may want based on our browsing history. However, I will concern about our privacy. Because for the recommendation system to work, a lots of privacy data will be access by organisations like Google, which included our personal information and our browsing habit. We have to pay attention of how those organisation get our data and how they use it, in order to protect our privacy."
64,29,20170325,7,"It is true that sentiment analysis is important for IT company, because of it is able to analysis the attitude of a product efficiently. With this technology we can know whether the product is success by analysis the data by computer, instead of do costly and time consuming marketing research. But there still is some time for the system to give a wrong justify. For example, if two comment are ""I like ABC product"" and ""I look like ABC product"", the system may justify both as positive because of the word""like"", but the meaning of the second sentence is not actually positive or even don't have any attitude to the product. So there is still room for improvement for sentiment analysis."
57,68,20170323,7,"I love your point which social media has provided a platform for people to share their lives. Through using social media, it spreads information effectively compared to the traditional method. However, this kind of effective way to spread information may have drawback. For example, if you do not protect your information well or say something bad on the internet or open unknown file, people can spread your information and use it in inappropriate way. Therefore, the better way is to speak carefully and be aware of unknown things."
48,68,20170324,7,"I love the way you say that Human Information Interaction can improve the quality of our life. There are many examples which information interaction improve our lives. I can understand why people may have negative concerns, it is because it may be quite dangerous if artificial intelligence take evolution in a place which we cannot control in some day. Although this concern is quite common, I still believe it can improve our lives. One of the examples is the robot can communicate with lonely older. That definitely brings some color in their lives."
69,68,20170324,7,"The ??six degrees of separation concept?? is fantastic, that general describe what how we interact with other through social network. The powerful thing of social network is that I can even talk or find somebody I do not know but he or she may relationship with my friend. There are many successful cases which people can find their separated parents or relatives through social media and that is exactly what ??six degrees of separation concept?? mentions."
72,68,20170324,7,"Your advice and the news are really inspiring. Indeed, social cognition is something that we cannot avoid. I love the sentence ??we should consider which value action is contribution??. Sometimes, we just simply copy others?? though or action without understanding. If that is a good thing, it is acceptable. However, it is quite dangerous if someone is doing bad thing. In my view, thinking of the consequence for each action may be helpful. If it is harm to someone, then don??t do that."
36,68,20170324,7,"I understand what is your concern. Indeed, if Amazon Go need be common and popular in Hong Kong, the priority part must be considered first. Since we purchase the product from our phone, it contains lots of personal information like credit card information, personal information, online behavior and so on. Unlike octopus, it just contains few information. Therefore, if the security part do not handle well, the consequence will be dangerous."
29,68,20170324,7,"I share the same view which social media cannot replace face-to-face communication. Although social media brings many advantages like meeting without distance restriction, something still cannot be replaced like emotional interaction. Sometime, a hug or giving a shoulder is better than any words. I love the point that trustful relationship is built under face-to-face interaction rather than communicate through social media."
8,68,20170325,7,"I would say GS1 really brings much convenience to us as a customer. As you mentioned, we can understand the status of the product if the company we can track the location of the product. In the past, you won??t know when the product would arrive. When GS1 is technology is created, the situation becomes different. It really brings confidence to customer since the company can provide the exact location of the product and arrival date. There is no need to worry about the loss of your product."
33,68,20170325,7,"I love the way you give your individual examples that makes the concept more clear. In my view, social media becomes the main part for receiving information which is the source of our social cognition. One of the examples is Facebook, it can provide lots of information including update news, page, post. Through this way, we can interact with other people and that can build the relationship with others."
68,68,20170324,7,"That is awesome. There is a teaching method called gamification which combine game and education together. It is quite successful for those who are in primary school and secondary school. However, it is hard to implement in undergraduate student because the game need to be attractive. I think VR technology can bring unprecedented experience to student. One of the examples can be applied to students who study history. They could use VR to travel historic places which may not exist."
75,68,20170325,7,"I agree that there is a trend of using more and more pictures to expressing meaning in cyber world. For example, whatsapp is going to introduce new emoji which contain facial emotion, animals or other interesting things. To me, I love the way of using emoji when I communicate with someone. It helps to deliver my feeling effectively. Sometimes, I found that emoji can simply replace what I want to say. I can say nothing but using emoji to reply message. Do you think it is a good way to communication which say nothing but just using emoji?"
69,68,20170325,7,"I love your introduction which simply explain where UX comes in. Indeed, some people are easy to feel satisfied even it is not the best solution, that makes UX become popular. One of the good example is Apple Watch. It contains many functions which are similar to smart phone. Although the functions between Apple Watch and phone are quite similar, Apple Watch still has its own market. The reason behind may be because of the simplicity. For example, Apple Watch can simply read and reply email instead of pulling the phone. Also, calendar notifications become easily notice. It is just slightly convenient than using smart phone, but that is enough to attract people to buy it. Do you think that is a great UX design?"
23,68,20170325,7,"I also have the same view which physical information is more reliable since semantic Information can be scanned before we say. However, physical is hard to hide if we want to cover something. For example, if you want to defend yourself for someone, you will probably put your arms in front of your body. That is not semantic Information can show."
7,68,20170325,7,"I agree that our action and perceptual system would be influenced our environment. Sometimes, some products may not essential to our lives, but we still buy it because we are influenced by the environment. One of the examples that the powerful function of the new phone shaped by advertisement will make you want to buy it even you got a phone already."
56,68,20170325,7,"In the past, Facebook is the dominant platform of social media. Nowadays, lots of social media are available as you mentioned like snapchat, twitter. Since there are many successful social media, it is hard for the people who want jump into this aspect now unless they provide unique thing that other platform does not have. For the future of social media, I wonder whether social media platform can combine the new technology like AR, VR. For example, providing VR game online can make user have enjoyable moment."
29,68,20170325,7,"I agree that smart technology really brings better lives to us since it has many convenient features like calendar notification, combing lives to technology. Many examples can indicate that smart technology make our lives better and it is common in daily lives. Although there is information that using smart technology may have security problem like information leaking, it seems that we cannot avoid smart technology comes into over lives."
51,68,20170325,7,"I can understand your concern which using emoji instead of language will weaken the language ability. However, I hold the different view. We speak language since we started to learn, language is the most effective way to express one??s mind and feeling. It may be hard to weaken the thing that we are used since we speak so many years. I would say, emoji can strength what we want to speech but it cannot replace what we want to say if the sentence is complicated."
44,30,20170322,7,"I have shocked as the author in that class, as I also chose the answer which is less chosen by other students. Being smart online and using social media are really a matter of being conscientious. It requires thinking through our posts/comments and being intentional. In the nowadays world, most of us are using social media. Our decision would be influenced by others easily. In my opinion, to avoid making a wrong decision, we need to set standards for ourselves. Also, in social media, there is a reckless disregard for content as many people post pictures and comments that are inappropriate, racy, and rude. Low standards lead to online bullying, smear campaigns, tarnished reputations, and social media nightmares. Thanks the author for reminding us to be a man with critical thinking."
69,30,20170322,7,"Social media has a powerful influence towards our daily life. But every coin in the world has two sides, not only the positive influences the social media has, but the negative influences, which would affect us mentally and even physically. Social networking sites such as Facebook, encourage people to be more public about their personal lives. Because intimate details of our lives can be posted so easily, users are prone to bypass the filters they might normally employ when talking about their private lives. What's more, the things they post remain available indefinitely. Technology makes it easy to intentionally and accidentally capture people in compromising positions. So before we post an image, we'd better study it first. Make sure everyone in the shot will not be impacted by the consequences. :P"
50,30,20170322,7,"When discussing whether sentiment analysis is always reliable or not, I think that the problem is that the more you break down the data, the less likely it is that sentiment analysis will get it right. Sentiment analysis works best with large amounts of data and can??t be relied upon for smaller samples. However, despite these limitations about the sentiment analysis, it is fast and close to real-time. It is very good at is spotting high-level trends and extreme swings in sentiment such as swearing and complaints which makes it great for social customer services. I think that what we can do with or improve the tool of sentiment analysis is to mixture human analysts and machine analysis together in the current development of sentiment analysis."
25,30,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing about what is contextual computing. Moreover, I think mobile computing is a subset of the contextual computing. The mobile devices can efficient as it allows direct communication with the sensors such iBeacon. With IoT, people can retrieve data faster with less effortand technical knowledge, just turning on the Bluetooth on the mobile device to acquire the information from signal. However, every coins in the world has two sides, there is no doubt that we can acquire information through contextual computing tools, we also need to consider the usage of contextual computing in a proper way. Less control over sensor configuration would lead the information leakage, which would make our privacy insecure and exposure to illegal parts. So we all need to learn the significant technical knowledge including hardware level embedded device programming and configuring to protect our privacy."
41,30,20170323,7,"As an adult, it is too difficult to tell whether we can live without social media or not. The adult has a stronger self-control mind to arrange the time spending on social media, such as avoiding using Facebook during working. However, I would like to concern about the how children and students using the social media, and the negative impact to them. Young minds are moldable, and social media can mold the way the children thinks or behaves. At their age, they are innocent and cannot discern good and bad. Social media also has a dark side. Too much social media can affect children and students' ability to develop strong interpersonal relationships."
33,30,20170323,7,"Human Information Interaction is an interdisciplinary topic or research. Human information interaction investigates the interaction between people and information with its multiple forms and purposes. In the side of people, it is a topic about sociology and psychology, which are studying how people use information to make decisions, plan courses of action, discover patterns in big data, solve problems, analyze situations, make sense of phenomena, learn new concepts, make forecasts about future trends, and so on. Another side of HII is information, it focuses on users of computers with the aim of defining principles and ways to present information that facilitates effective human information interaction. As an Information Engineering students, we can develop models and theories of interaction, as well as methodologies and processes for designing interfaces and for implementing and evaluating them."
48,30,20170323,7,"After reading your article, I raise a question about why social media is penetrating the Hong Kong society in recent years. In my opinion, one of the reason is that the productivity and quantity of the traditional mass media such as TV news and newspaper are becoming less and worse respectively. The traditional mass media has a restricted access for us to express our mind and information. Also, their news and information can not be received by us instantly or share to others in a short time. However, the social media and instant chat app provide our new generation a platform to express our idea and information to others such Facebook, Whatsapp and twitter. Although Hong Kong is a small city, we can share our information with other friends all around the world easily by social networking."
60,30,20170323,7,"Thank you for sharing and summarizing what is information foraging. In my experience, the usage and result of Google search is becoming better and better, we can more easily to seek the information we need. As a user, we all the we can find out the information in a efficient way. However, as a blogger or not a end user, we may hope that our blog or information can be search by others. That is the technique about search engine optimization (SEO). SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. No matter information foraging or SEO, both of them are providing an efficient way to help people in information interaction."
34,30,20170323,7,"Although nowadays the accuracy of the sentiment Analysis by a machine is not as high as a human, it provides us an efficient method to analysis the sales rate and the marketing reaction by the customers. In my opinion, sentiment analysis can not be used as an accurate tool in evaluating one's thought and mind, but it can be used as a fast and powerful tool to predict the marketing and sales rate of a product, also enhance the SEO of the product and company in the social media."
74,30,20170324,7,"When thinking about UX design, the definition includes how that experience can be manipulated or influenced by the designer to increase the quality of that experience for the user. Good user experience increases the adoption of that product. Moreover, thank you for your summarization for the implication of physical information affordance and satisficing to user experience (UX). In my opinion, I am impressed by your introduction about the part of users?? satisfaction. As a designer, I think it difficult to balance the standard between the product owner and the end user, so that the product is satisfied the requirements to everyone."
71,30,20170324,7,"I think the stage of computers understanding a person is currently getting near and near. Recently, Google made history when its DeepMind-based artificial intelligence AlphaGo unequivocally defeated the second highest ranking Go player in the world, Lee Sedol of Korean. AlphaGo is a super cloud computing machine, which can be used to predict the human behavior. As you mentioned in your article, if a computer can gather the information to build the four graphs of a human, then this computer can predict the behavior of a human, so as AlphaGo. Also, AlphaGo's algorithm uses a combination of machine learning and tree search techniques, combined with extensive training, both from human and computer play. It uses Monte Carlo tree search, guided by a ""value network"" and a ""policy network,"" both implemented using deep neural network technology, which are the techniques to make these four graphs more acceptable by machines and computers."
28,17,20170322,7,"Definitely, semantic information is widely used nowadays. You, the author, gave an example that you will use ??emojis?? and words to chart with others. Sometimes, I think ??emojis?? are bit confusing because the meaning of the ??emojis?? are based on user experience. With different life experience, the meaning would be different. Take the following article as an example.http://topick.hket.com/article/1412401/%E4%B8%8D%E5%86%8D%E8%A1%A8%E9%8C%AF%E6%83%85%E3%80%80%E6%8B%86%E8%A7%A3Emoji%20%E7%9A%84%E7%9C%9F%E6%AD%A3%E6%84%8F%E6%80%9DThe designer created ??emojis?? for meaning A. Unfortunately, we sometimes misunderstand the emoji and wrongly express our opinion. However, with word and emoji, I think that the receiver can exactly get what sender??s meaning."
58,17,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I do agree Human-Information Interaction is important nowadays. As you have mention that HII is to study the interaction between people and information. Also, we can use huge of information data to do some innovation. For example, as what I have shared in my blog, we may notice that game lovers may want to VR apply in games. Therefore, we are not hard to see VR games. Finally, I would like to share a YouTube video to all of you. This video is talking about VR in game field. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5_hokvr8GQ"
63,17,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. Human information interaction is essential nowadays. For example, as what you have mentioned, companies can promote their products to service, which are suitable for customer. In addition, those data can apply in different fields. I would like to share following article to you all.https://www.simplilearn.com/big-data-applications-in-industries-articleThis article is talking about the application of Big Data. For instance, education institution can investigate how much time is spend on different pages by students. I believe that those data can improve our life present and in the future."
63,17,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I do agree that we should study semantic information. Through studying this information, we can notice the habits of human and our computer can select some suitable information for us. However, I think these information is confusing sometimes. For example, we will use a picture or icon to express our opinion. Unfortunately, due to different life experience, we have different understanding related to the picture. I would like to take following picture as an example.https://travelhappy.vic.gov.au/svgs/icon-learned-misunderstandings-59.svgSome people may think they are speaking foul language. But some may think that they are speaking in different languages and they cannot communicate with each other. Thus, sometimes it is hard to study semantic information."
16,17,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I do agree with you that Human-information interaction is everywhere. In addition, I think HII can make our relationship closer. For example, traditionally, we will send a letter to our friends and waiting for reply. Now, we can just open social medias, such as WhatsApp, Snapchat and communicate with others. In addition, because of HII, we have to send information to the internet. Therefore, we have signal analysis and networking protocols to transmit the data and our major is created."
16,17,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I do agree that two of IT trends for upcoming 10 year are augmented reality and virtual reality. For example, recently, Pok??mon Go has become a hot game. One of the reasons is this game is using AR technologies. It combines the view of real environment and virtual item on the users?? screen. It is very interesting. Besides, virtually reality technology has applied in different fields. For example, some learner will use VR to learn a new language. The following YouTube showed the situation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thvjp8BCHskWith using VR, we can easily to remember or recognize a new things because it seems that we can interact with virtually item."
16,17,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. There are a lot of resource in the internet nowadays. How to select a suitable suggestion to the user has become a hot issue. You have mentioned that since some industries may put misleading advertisement through the system, therefore, recommendation system may intrude our life. That is true. In order to increase their profit, they may do that. However, I do think recommendation system is useful for us. First of all, the system can help us to select more suitable topics. As we all know that there are a lot of irrelevant information in the internet. Filter function is need for us. Secondly, we can know recent and hot issue through the internet. When we are surfing the YouTube, it will recommend such kind of videos. Therefore, we can know more about what happens about us."
76,17,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. Online shopping brings a lot of benefit for us. As what you have mentioned, it is very convenient as we can just click the product regardless time and place, the product will be sent to your home. Sometimes, we want to find old products, due to the variety of the product, we may find them on the online shop. In addition, I think there is one more advantage, which is review system. If we are surfing Taboo, user may comment the product. Base on the review, we have less chance to buy a fake and judge that whether it is suitable for yourself. Finally, I would like to share the following website to all of you. This website is talking about the advantages that online shopping brings us.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/connecting-britain/why-online-shopping-is-better-than-in-store/"
42,17,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I think social media is an important tool in this century. In the past, we can only have one-on-one communication. For example, we can send a letter to our friend to express our view. The communication process is slow. But now, we can express message through social media. For instance, several school societies will use mass message and Facebook page to promote their activities. Social media make our relationship closer."
42,17,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. Human information interaction is important nowadays. Through data analysis, we can observe people habit and create some innovative product. VR is one of the examples. As we may observe that people may want to go virtually world. VR is a machine that can simulate a virtual environment for the user. Therefore, we apply VR in different fields.Analyzing those data is a big issue for information engineer. In addition, we have also learned a lot of network security and network protocol and these knowledges can make those data transmit more safety."
74,17,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. HII brings many advantages to us. First of all, by using those information, we can study human behaviors. In addition, we can make more accurate recommendation system for the user. As an information student, HII is an important topic to us. As what you have mentioned, we should make highly interactive system interface to the user. Also, in order to make the data transmission more safety, we will study network security. Therefore, HII is around us and highly related to IE students."
12,17,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I do agree that social media play an important role in this century. As u have mentioned that, social media can help us spread the message and receive recent issue. In addition, service provider can be easily to find out potential customer. It does create opportunities for business. Finally, I would like to share a link to all of you.https://www.lifewire.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-social-networking-3486020This article is talking the advantages and disadvantages of social networking. With good use of social media, we can have a great future."
26,75,20170324,7,"Machine learning seems to be a powerful tool of improving human??s nowadays technology. While you have mentioned a lot of advantages of machine learning, I would also like to raise up some downsides and concerns of it.As known, the mechanism of machine learning is to analyze the most rewarding output the machine can make in order to maximize the reinforcement. Just imagine if the machine is used to help people make decisions, it seems to become a big trouble as the machine only knows how to maximize the profit but ignore other aspects that we would care in our human world. It is true that the machine may be able to make the most ??rational?? decision but in fact, humans do not only live with rationality, we have emotions, sensations, relationships and so on. We make a lot of effort to strive a balance between various aspects throughout our lives. Although it is true that machine works very well in playing chess and analyzing big data, it can never replace human??s mind and wisdom in the future. But I really hope that machine learning can play more important role in the future, as it is helping our live."
26,75,20170324,7,"Yes, it is true that content analysis brings us a lot convenience nowadays. But one should be noticed that, in this commercialized world, the result provided by the search engine is not merely by quantitative approach and qualitative approach, but also marketing approach. Some companies would collaborate with the search engine, paying them money and prioritize their brands on the top of the searching results.It comes to an issue of the trustworthiness of the information displayed on the Internet. We should be aware that the online information is not necessarily true and suitable for the users. Rather, many companies try to intentionally create a demand and need of their products so as to gain profits."
68,75,20170324,7,"Yes, the point you said that the context comes from both sides which are from the side of providers and side of you. It is true that when the society becomes happy and peaceful, the residents create a relaxing context rather than the aggressive type of context. When they dissatisfy with the situation, the context is full of complaints and angers. From the above cases, we will be affected by above situations easily. This is kind of receivers, we cannot separate from it and we will be fit in the situation. Also, the purpose of people creating a context wants the others to join inside and follow the logic. We can join inside the context or just understand the context. It is wise to not be only a receiver that receives an information only but an observer that analyzes the context."
30,75,20170323,7,"There are billions of users to use the smartphone. I agree your point that smartphone is providing a way to connect people to people by the internet. Also, people can get the information through the online social media easily. However, I am thinking two points which are the credibility of information and the people attitude of seeking the consent of the others. There are many messages which are unconfirmed and with some false. The net rumor is one of the examples. So I think that the duty of the social media is keeping thing to be true and let the people trust the social media. On the other hands, Most of the people will have the same idea to attract friends and try to stay away from the expression of different views of people. It is easy for people to read only the messages and opinions they have published because everyone wants to be recognized by others and wants their information that is uploaded to Facebook will not be judged by people. Therefore, the results have made some people are reluctant to express their true views so as to be recognized and avoid being isolated. Therefore, I think that we should keep our original ideas and be optimistic to accept people opinions in order to make ourselves are different to the others."
29,75,20170324,7,"Grant, you give a good view which is the importance of the Human Information Interaction to the information student. Because the convenience of the user interface is the key to the success of the website design. I will say that studying the way how they prefer getting information on the website or mobile app and design what they want. It can attract them to use our engineering product. Moreover, the most of the material that we are studying in the lecture is about computer information interaction.It should be a change to focus on the human to information or information to human so as to improve the efficiency of mutual interaction and information interaction. We can find the changes in the past years which are from ICQ(computer to computer) to Whatsapp (mobile phone to mobile phone). So Human Information Interaction is important now."
50,75,20170323,7,"I also see you point of view about the education problems in Hong Kong. And it is without doubt using advanced technology in classroom could provide wide ranges of advantages in teaching and learning, especially boosting students?? motivation to learn.However, I think you misunderstood the term machine learning, which refers to the ability of the artificial intelligence to learn by itself. And in fact, schools nowadays are actually, already using mobile apps, computer games and online platform to provide different learning materials to students. To make use of machine learning in tailor-making individualized educational plan, we could develop programs that can evaluate students?? performance in tests and assignment by analyzing the data of their exams and homework over years, and give suggestions according to their strength and weakness. In this way, the machine learns by itself about the students?? abilities and weaknesses, and it solves the ??one-size-fit-all?? problems in Hong Kong education system."
29,75,20170324,7,"I also think that social media shall never replace face-to-face communication, but in my opinion, both of them have their own values in human communication.Regarding your argument, I come up two questions. As your source is from Psychology Today. I would also discuss it from psychological perspective. You mentioned that people would hide their emotions in social media very easily. I strongly agree to this. People do not only hide their emotions but also strategically filter poor information about themselves so that they only show the bright side of themselves. But what I wonder is that people would actually do the same thing during face-to-face communication, so why would it be a disadvantage of social media only? Just think of your daily life. Would you expose your true self to everyone? Of course not. So I think it is a common human behavior, but not necessarily attribute to social media.The second question is about the nonverbal signals, like tone of voices. With nowadays technology, actually we could deliver voice message to friends and relatives. Do you think it is resolution of the problems?"
72,75,20170324,7,"I understand what you have mentioned before and the example is nice to do the discussion. Social cognition is a great topic to discuss. Although we may tease their silly action which is rush to buy table salt to avoid radiation, I think their decisions can be explained. In my opinion, they want to protect themselves and save their lives. So no matter what are people doing, they will trend to follow and trust them. Social cognition bases on people learning from their own cognitive structures and life experiences to do the responses. If it can bring them some benefits, they will try to do it surely. Therefore, I think we should understand ourselves first and understand how the psychological characteristics, motives, life experiences and modality are controlling ourselves. So that we can know why people will buy table salt to avoid radiation and we can stop ourselves to fall into the same error in the future."
7,75,20170324,7,"I agree your two points that HCI and HII are important for engineering students. In my opinion, HCI and HII are important to create the user interface. I agree your point that HII is important and I think HII shows more human factors about how the users use the application. After knowing how people think an idea, how people store their information and how people present the information. We engineer can create more secure and user-friendly application to the people. HII change our engineer thinking from telling people how the application can be used to how to fulfill the user needs. So I appreciate you that you tell me HII becomes more important for the information student."
69,75,20170325,7,"I agree your point that users experience is important to this moment. For the users who are not professional in the technology want to use the app or online application. The first impression of application is ??how can I use it???. Therefore, as you mentioned before, simple may be good enough. If they can navigate the applications easily and find out that the application is easy to use it, people will use it again after experiencing the application. For a designer like we should think about it seriously. Apart from the simple of the application, the first impression design should be another point in UX that we should concern. People decide whether an application is worth their time just in short period of time. So we should design it beautifully. Facebook, Youtube and Apple store are the successful examples of the outlook design that really attracts the eye from the users."
29,75,20170325,7,"I see your points and I agree that smart technology do help to improve our live. There are a lot of examples. The smart technology helps us to notify our heaths. For example, you can wear the apple watch when you are doing exercise or use the functions which are step record inside the smart phone. Furthermore, the smart technology helps the people learn new thing effectively. We can use a pad to search the material that we do not familiar with immediately. Obviously, we will see some privacy problems when we are using the smart technology. To be an engineer, we should design a more secure product to the customer. To be resident, we should have the sense to keep upgrading our equipment like upgrading the latest version of android or ios, browser, and software. Also, we should try to unlink the accounts as the linked accounts can be stolen by hacker easily. Finally, we should change our using internet habit. We should think carefully before giving our personal information. I think person privacy is priceless. We should have the sense to know how to protect our privacy."
36,75,20170325,7,"Thank you for your sharing. For me, I am glad to see that Amazon Go can bring a new style of shopping in the future. We will not use any real money but use the electronic money to shopping. There is no need to queue and no need change which means it can save a lot of time. However, I have worries to the Amazon Go. First, people will not have any privacy when they enter the Amazon Go as there are multiple cameras and microphones. Also, the Amazon may save and analysis your purchase record. Can I reject what they are doing to project my privacy? Second, there is problem of after-sales service. How can I return the product after leaving the Amazon Go? Also, how can I give back the product when I find that I buy a wrong product?Anyway, thank you for your sharing."
3,75,20170325,7,"Thank you for your sharing. For me, I think the recommendation system is useful as I love to watch the videos like MV or funny animal videos in the YOUTUBE. Also, sometimes I will purchase the clothes or models through the Taobao company. The recommendation system provides a lot of choices to me and it is saving my time. However, I hope that the recommendation system can be improved. I hope that the recommendation system will not suggest the thing that I watch before. It is a disappointing that I see the same video in the recommendation list appearing again and again without the changing. Also, the recommendation system is the machine recognizable. It only can distinguish the word of description of the product but sometimes when I saw the photo of the product in Taobao which is not matching to my expectation. Finally, I think recommendation system is really good to help the company to make more profit."
45,75,20170325,7,"Yes, I agree that AR becomes the more popular issue now and AR helps to mix the virtual information and people. AR does help the company to run a business like a game, AR fitting room or AR Greeting card. AR is mixing the information and reality. However, I am worried about that when we focus too much on the VR device like the smart phone screen, it will cause a lot of problems. For example, we are playing Pokemon Go on the road. We may not see any obstacles in front of you and it may cause an accident.Here is the news of the accidents.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3793050/Don-t-Pokemon-drive-110-000-road-accidents-caused-game-just-10-days.html"
30,75,20170325,7,"Yes, NLP is useful to analysis the users comment. As machine language is kind of logic which is different from the daily dialog, NLP can be used to handle and sort the human language. The current web search engine basically still remains in the keyword match. There is the lack of deep natural language processing and understanding. The development of NLP improves the use of speech recognition and text recognition and machine translation. I hope that the NLP will keep on improving and play an important role in the future information interaction."
68,75,20170325,7,"Thank you for your sharing and tell me that machine learning is bringing a better life for us. The machine learning is important as it is used to do the banking, financial sector and health care issues and many aspects. So I agree that it is crucial. Also, I understand your worry that the machine learning may be used to hurting the human. So I think there are some rules to set up and make sure human can use it correct way which should benefit human only.On the other hands, I am interested that the future development of machine learning which is identifying objects in images and words in sounds. Hope that machine learning becomes more powerful and we can enjoy it."
37,26,20170322,7,"I agree to you that computer see things differently from that of humans. Similar items in computer??s mindset are actually calculations and most of them are done through analysis. I think these mathematics only partially show the similarities between two items. In fact, human beings have emotions and thoughts and could actually see the implied meanings behind certain objects, so the similarity results of humans are different than that of computers. On top of that, I think human beings could relate information easier than computers, this is why studying human information interaction is important."
55,62,20170322,7,"It is really a warm remind that maintain our daily life and do more exercise can optimize our cognitive function. Actually, our cognitive function is very important to us since we keep using this function and we are unable to stop this function by ourselves. So we should try our best to keep this function work in the best quality to provide good performance. That's why the doctors always recommend people the do exercise after they wake up. This is obviously clear our mind."
14,62,20170322,7,"It is a really sad truth that shows the current education system is forcing the student not to think too much and just follow by the senior. No doubt that many students under the education system have become less creative, and only copy the concept from the authority. However, the current education will also teach students critical thinking, the students will also learn how to judge the argument and the idea from the others. Based on their knowledge accumulated day by day, they will have the ability to classify what is right and what is wrong. Although sometimes they may need to obey the seniors, the most important thing is can find out the truth by themselves."
69,62,20170323,7,"I agree with you that how social networks connect people together. Social networks have changed the way of our living and link people around the world together into a global village. It makes communication way easier than ten years ago. Even if we lost someone's contact, we will be able to find them through social networks easily. However, some people also said that social networks actually make the distance between each other bigger. As we tend to share a lot on the internet while talk with our friends less in real life. So, social networks are beneficial and harmful at the same time to our relationship which depends on how we use it."
13,62,20170323,7,"This article mentioned a very important point that when the latest trend is talking about the use of big data. Big data provided so many information for us to discover. However, when we are doing the process for filtering the useful information, this also means that there are so many useless or irrelevant data too. So, we should apply different criteria for the process of filtering. HII is one of the good criteria for filtering since the purpose of big data analysis is to enhance the user experience. If the result of the analysis can let the readers receive the information in a more comfortable way. No doubt this is a win-win situation for the readers and the information providers."
73,62,20170323,7,"For talking about the passive context, iBeacon is a good representative for it. The iBeacon can be attached to something that is worn or carried, or in a wristband or a name tag. In this configuration, the iBeacon is ??pinging?? and receiving stations are located in areas where you want to pick up the signal. The user, in this case, does not need to do anything but wear the iBeacon. No phones are needed. No apps needed. The iBeacons, in this case, are passively recording and triggering user actions. Under this feature, retail stores can track shopper in their shop where they are using carts and baskets. The iBecaons can be attached to them and as the shopper walks around the store you can get ??heat?? maps information and the path through the store. This information can be used to more effectively drive people to promotions and drive sales of higher value goods. At the same time, retail stores can configure alerts to staff when certain conditions are met. For example, when there are big lines at the checkout, you can automatically notify staff."
1,62,20170323,7,"I also agree your point. According to a Morgan Stanley report, most people don??t see a quick checkout as a particularly big deal. In fact, it was an important factor for only about 30% of the people they surveyed, versus 50% who cared about prices and 70% who wanted a convenient location. Also more important than quick checkout: selection, high-quality products, and good weekly sales and promotions. What??s more, Amazon??s advantage in checkout times is already narrowing. Traditional grocery stores have made progress at reducing times considerably -- Kroger lowered its average checkout wait time to 30 seconds from 3-4 minutes historically, according to Morgan Stanley. And Wal-Mart??s mobile app now allows for quick scan and go purchases at Sam??s Club. As the result, it seems that only Amazon is excited about its new Amazon Go food markets, where people can check out using just their smartphones. But consumers don??t care that much about quick checkout compared to other factors."
70,62,20170323,7,"Beside the GPS that mentioned in the article can provide contextual computing, there are some other technologies can also provide the contextual computing. The first on is wearable computing. Google Glass is obviously the most visible example of wearable computing, you can wear it and it can provide you some relative information immediately. Big data and data computation is the second trend. Our daily digital lives are creating petabytes of digital exhaust about where we were, what we did, what we saw, and what we said. This provides a rich source of information about our preferences and our future behaviors. Sensor data is exploding. We have wearable sensors for heart rates, but you can also buy sensors for your house plants or for the air quality in your office. All these technologies are contributing data for the contextual computing and analysis"
76,62,20170323,7,"I also like to use the recommendation system in the songs streaming app. However, sometimes I feel disappointed because the songs are repeated. Obsuasvioly this is a disadvantage of the recommendation system that we don??t get very much diversity or surprise in recommendations system, so recommendations tend to be kind of ??obvious?? and boring for the user sometimes."
71,62,20170323,7,"It is a interesting idea that applying VR into education. Although VR has lots of advantages that might be able to enhance the teaching process, such as putting students into a more relaxing environment, I still think that it is not suitable to implement. First, using the VR into education requires students to put on the handset and earphone which might harm students' eyesight. Learning need lots of concentration. If they need to highly concentrate in the VR handset, their eyes will be more exhausting then focus on the blackboard. Second, the cost is too high for implementation as well. Virtual Reality is still in the beginning stage which is not really common so it is expensive to use it as a teaching tool. So I think applying VR into education is an interesting but it still have a long way to go and wait for some breakthrough improvement of VR"
63,62,20170324,7,"Let me supplement some information about the application of semantic data. Semantic data is very promising for the enterprise world. Database Management Systems can be integrated with one another and compared. For example, since a company's entire infrastructure is represented within the data model, the model can be compared to those of the company's vendors to identify areas of inconsistency and possible improvement. This would help streamline the relationship between company and vendors, making database sharing and integration much simpler. Environments and systems can also be organized graphically within a database to give a more visually-based representation of that system or environment. Recently, a semantic language called Gellish was developed as a formal language to represent data models. Gellish can be interpreted solely by computers and needs no human interaction."
48,62,20170324,7,"Social media is possibly the most vital sector of the Internet, but, being open and social creates legitimate concerns about privacy and safety. Headlines warning of online security breaches are just one reminder of the vulnerability of all websites, including social media outlets.Despite these justifiable security concerns about the Web, some of the reasons a person's social media account is compromised are self-induced. Six common mistakes that can expose an account include:1. Forgetting to Log Out2. Clicking on Enticing Ads3. Connecting With Strangers4. Using Third Party Apps5. Exposing Too Much Information6. Failing to Utilize Security SettingsActually these mistakes we must heard them before, but we always accidentally fall in these mistakes. So we should be more careful to avoiding these mistakes"
73,62,20170324,7,"Opinion mining can be useful in several ways. It can help marketers evaluate the success of an ad campaign or new product launch, determine which versions of a product or service are popular and identify which demographics like or dislike particular product features. For example, a review on a website might be broadly positive about a digital camera, but be specifically negative about how heavy it is. Being able to identify this kind of information in a systematic way gives the vendor a much clearer picture of public opinion than surveys or focus groups do because the data is created by the customer. However, there are also several challenges in opinion mining. The first is that a word that is considered to be positive in one situation may be considered negative in another situation. Take the word ""long"" for instance. If a customer said a laptop's battery life was long, that would be a positive opinion. If the customer said that the laptop's start-up time was long, however, that would be is a negative opinion. These differences mean that an opinion system trained to gather opinions on one type of product or product feature may not perform very well on another. A second challenge is that people don't always express opinions the same way. Most traditional text processing relies on the fact that small differences between two pieces of text don't change the meaning very much. In opinion mining, however, ""the movie was great"" is very different from ""the movie was not great""."
6,62,20170322,7,"This is a quite interesting article that talks about the ambiguity of the order of the words in the news title. Actually, no matter in a Chinese or English newspaper, there are some many news titles are not clear or ambiguous. Some of them maybe a mistake took by the editor, but most of them are designed by the editor to create a funny title to let the news become more eye-catching. Under this reason, the reader will be more intent to read the article since they will want to find out what is the actual meaning of the article is talking about. This is a tricky way to attract more readers attention."
55,62,20170322,7,"Thank you for sharing. I agree that transform to digital learning environment is good for learning. The shift from print to digital is a profound transition in how human beings learn, it is more significant than the development of the printing press and its benefits are spreading much more quickly. Like the printing press six centuries ago, this transition is transforming formal education and spreading informal learning opportunities. Digital learning is providing benefits in these seven aspects that are changing the opportunity set for teachers. 1. Personalized learning 2. Expanded learning opportunities3. High engagement learning 4. Competency-based learning 5. Assessment for learning 6. Collaborative learning 7. Quality learning productsUnder this situation, both teachers and students can teach and learn in a more effective way, this is a win-win situation for a learning environment."
51,62,20170324,7,"I agree that the emoji is weakening people's ability of language. Also, I think the emoji is going the destroy the culture of language. The growing use of these icons could potentially lead to further miscommunication. The emoji's ambiguous meaning that could lead to confusion because users can look at an emoji and take different things from it. Here's one example: the emoji that illustrates two folded hands. This emoji started in Japan where the symbol represented salutation or gratitude. Other cultures interpret this emoji to symbolize prayer, while millennials often see this symbol belonging to two different people giving each other a high five. Therefore, although emoji is providing some benefit for us, we should also make good use and keep the balance with words when we use it in our communication."
10,62,20170324,7,"Thanks for your sharing. I also think that the digital environment will be the new trend in the world. Amazon, Taobao and Instagram shop, all these are using the digital environment to setting up a store. As what Winsome said in the blog, more information detail and more time to do research for the product are provided by online stores. However, we should also think about the compatibility of all the users from different age should be able to enjoy the shopping process. So I think the ease of use is also a main concern when we moving to a digital environment."
47,74,20170322,7,"I highly agree with your point that we can design information systems in a better way after we have understood HII. HII emphasizes on the interaction between human and information, so that we can through analyzing the information data to make things more related to human??s expectations. For example, we can collect the information about human??s activities and preferences when they are browsing a website, such that improving the website??s design and architectures. As an engineer, it is important for us to know the users?? needs before designing things."
47,74,20170322,7,"I also think that iBeacon is a powerful technology. It provides indoor positioning, which can help locating people?? position, and allow some applications provide information to users. But only got iBeacon is not enough, context computing plays an important role here. It helps computing information and base on the database, give us some tailor-made information. For example, recommendation systems give recommendations to users by analyzing their preferences and browsing history. So for iBeacon, for example, if consumers are standing near new shoes, some apps may pop up and recommend similar type of shoes to them."
47,74,20170322,7,"I also think that N-gram is a powerful technique. One of the examples of N-gram is Google Book??s N-Gram Viewer, when we search ??Information Engineering??, we know that this term never appear before 1953. And this term become more popular from time to time. N-gram is useful for NLP. It helps the computer to get a better understanding of human language, which would be very useful in AI. N-gram needs a big database, and nowadays, big data is much well-known and more and more companies are working on it, hence we can see that NLP improved with time. It would be great if future we can use our human language to do programming! :)"
47,74,20170322,7,"I appreciate your point on linking machine learning to big data. In fact, I do think that machine learning cannot process well without big data. Big data allow data to analyze in an efficient and large-scale way. For example, business informatics and Internet Search, all require big data to do. And machine learning is data driven, which need big data technologies to process huge amount of data, with a wide range of datasets. Therefore, I think in the future, along with the fast development of big data, machine learning will be more well-developed, and the technologies that required machine learning such as AI with become more advanced."
4,74,20170322,7,"Your example on CSCW has inspired me a lot. I think if we want to develop such technical support platforms for people to communicate around the world, it is important that we should analyze the interaction between human and information first. And that is what HII??s keystone. For example, we have to study what information is related to which field of people, and understand how the information can connect to human (in what way and what extend). Therefore, as an engineer, we can design the systems that help people to cooperate with each other even they come from different field, changing the way of information exchange, hence improving the efficiency and quality."
4,74,20170323,7,"Contextual Computing is really important to our life. Without a doubt, we even rely much on it, although we don??t aware. For example, when we buy things on Amazon, the website will shows a lot of similar products to us, this is by contextual computing. But I have the same concern with you-- privacy. We have to look carefully whether the related websites will expose our personal information or preference to others. But overall contextual computing have big potential to make great change to our life in future, which may change our way of life, for instance, it helps us choose the suitable clothes to go out."
4,74,20170323,7,"You have explained what ??satisfice?? is and how it was applied. I agree that satisficing is inevitably a strategy for making decisions in life. In this information age, we received huge amount of information every day, and we just don??t have that much time to analyze all those information and hence making the decisions. Therefore, products that have high satisficing are especially important in our life. As an engineer, we should always remind ourselves to design product that can really make user??s life easier, with minimum effort, to maximum the outcome. For example, always stick to UX design, which stand on the user side and think of the design."
4,74,20170323,7,"In my opinion, just as you said, sentiment analysis is undoubtedly useful for business purpose. Since the Internet become more and more widely used, and lots of information is moving to the Internet such as restaurant or movie reviews. Those large amounts of information cannot be read and analyzed one by one manually. Therefore what we need is sentiment analysis. It helps us to analysis the infinite information in a short time, letting the companies or organization to base on the analyzed data to proposal new ideas or improvement. But I still think the accuracy sentiment analysis is a concern. What if my comment is ironic, saying ??it is very good that I use 3 hours to unpack the box??, because of the keyword ??very good??, the comment is categorized as positive. Those similar problems still need to be addressed in the future."
72,74,20170323,7,"I appreciate your example on the news that saying people rush to buy salt in attempt to prevent radiation. Social cognition is really an interesting thing to study. Our choices are easily affected by others all the days. I remember that there is a funny social experiment: In an elevator, all actors are facing the wall of the elevator, when people get into the elevator and see everyone are facing against the door, they turn their body and did the same thing. The example tells us that our beliefs, as you mentioned, did mirrored the public mind set. It is important that we should think more before making decision, considering if the action is worth to do or did have value to do."
72,74,20170323,7,"I think your example of Amazon Go is a good illustration of context computing. One of the ultimate goals of context computing is to bring convenience to our life. And with Amazon Go, we can save a lot of time because we don??t have to queue. It also saves lots human resources. Context computing makes life easier. But we have to admit that as you said, wrong compiling may occur. Therefore I think in future, how to construct a large enough and more precise database is what we engineer can improve in context computing."
72,74,20170323,7,"Thank you for your summarize on the kind of program languages. As an engineer, semantic function is something that we are facing and working on every day. They are very important in computer science. We can see that all those three type of program languages are containing many notations, this are some standards for the computer to know what command we are trying to give it. We should appreciate the beauty of it, because it can express a long string of sentence (meaning) in few characters. Just like your figure1, one line of denotational semantics can represent 3 lines of words. In the future, we look forward to having some more easy-understand program languages, and can effectively transfer our human language to program language, in an efficient way."
72,74,20170323,7,"Your example on comparing the search path with strong and weak scent is really interesting. The graph clearly made me know the importance of having a good information scent. It inspires me as an engineer, for example, we should design some systems or websites that distributing and passing the information to users in a smart way, letting them find out what they need in a short time with minimum effort by giving some hints on it. Information Foraging Theory gives us the trace for knowing and analyzing how human needs. I also think that we should follow the guidance to fulfill user??s expectations."
50,74,20170323,7,"I think you have linked HII to our daily life, which is an important thing that we should understand first about HII. We are engineers, one day we will have to involve in developing systems that make people live better. To give a direct example, writing a website to allow people obtain knowledge, we have to make sure such information are distributed in an effective, efficient and accurate way. In daily life we come across with various communication systems even we don??t aware it. And we have to pay more attention on it, discovering the interaction between human and information for future systems design because we are engineers."
50,74,20170323,7,"I agree that social media indeed helps a lot for our university students. I think in the past, with no Internet, people will focus more on one-to-one communication, by really conducting a conversation will the professors, as well as going to library to look for the books (one-to-many). But now, there are a lot of online discussion platforms that allow many-to-many communication, from my personal experience, I really rely on Stack Overflow when I am studying my programming courses. I think social media play an important role not only on learning, but also in our daily life, for example, making friends and business activities."
50,74,20170323,7,"Sentiment analysis is indeed a useful tool in this information age. But just as you said, sentiment analysis still has it limitation, which is it may not be always reliable. Apart from your example of double positives/negatives, I also think that the analysis cannot really work well if the comments have some behind meanings, or maybe the people are saying sarcastic or ironic comments. Besides, what if the people spell the wrong word? If they spell ??not?? to ??nto??, without detecting the word ??not??, the whole meaning of the comment is reversed. But overall we still rely on sentiment analysis a lot and we cannot ignore its importance. In the future, this is our job of engineer to tackle those problems in sentiment analysis, how to increase its accuracy, for example, doing some works on big data to make a strong and big enough database for processing sentiment analysis."
50,74,20170323,7,"Thank you for your opinion on applying machine learning in education. Now it is a digital age, we even cannot live without Internet. Putting education into digital world brings lots of advantages, in addition to your example, I am thinking of some self-learning platforms, which allows students to do tests generated by systems, etc. However, it is not enough that only rely on digital learning. The traditional learning still has its advantages, so that the best way for education is the mix of two. Digital learning involved much less human-to-human interaction, one of the important things that ??education?? needs us to learn is how should we get along with people, communication skills is important in the society, these are harder to achieve with only digital learning."
67,66,20170323,7,"I agree that technology weakens the connection between one and other in real life because people are too focus on the information in the mobile phones. However, we cannot deny that technology helps us to connect people and information. I cannot imagine how will the society be without technology, as we now all rely on technology to get adequate information. So, how to adopt a good behavior towards technology is important, as it can help us to strike a balance between the virtual life and the real life."
74,66,20170323,7,"Digital information is totally different from physical and semantic information. As an engineering student, we should be more familiar with the digital information. So, I think the job of us is to build a good bridge to connect the reality and the digital world. We have to use the knowledge we gain from the university, translate the problem to a digital side with some calculations and convert the solution back to reality. Therefore, I think the important thing is to familiar with both information, so that we can develop the best solution."
24,66,20170323,7,"I do agree that content analysis is useful. With the help of content analysis, we can easily found out the trend. Nowadays, the volume of content in the internet is increasing, content analysis plays an important role as it helps us mine the mass data to obtain a fast solution. Therefore, this technology is useful when we are making decision."
63,66,20170323,7,"It is undoubtedly that context computing can provide some great suggestions to us. However, there are some limitations too. Besides the trust problem mentioned, the understanding of computer is also one of the major problems. For example, the recommendation system is mainly using some mathematical formula to calculate the marks of similarity. However, human mind is much more sophisticated than a number, so, I think that improving the understanding of computer is the next issue, so that we can have better solutions provided by computers in future."
72,66,20170323,7,"One of the most significant benefits of context computing is to save our time as most of the information are handled by the devices (Internet of Things). The Amazon Go example is to show how the time is saved by the payment is handled by the sensor and phone. However, the trade-off of convenience is security. Take Amazon Go as the example, the credit card information maybe steal by others during payment or by other malicious sensors approach your phone. One possible solution is to enhance the encrypt during the payment process. However, this requires more time to finish the process which affects the efficiency. So, the future question is how to protect the information of users while the product efficiency can be kept."
47,66,20170323,7,"I do think machine learning and big data are relying on each other. Without machine leaning, the big data is hard to be mined by human as human cannot handle the sea amount of data in a short time. Without big data, the machine cannot learn well as the amount of data is not large enough, this affects the accuracy of the algorithm. All criteria like business, science and sociology require data analysis for research and decision making, with the help of machine learning and big data, we can have a better solution analyzed from the large amount of data."
27,66,20170323,7,"Social recommendation provides different suggestions which make our life more convenient. However, computers do not have the mind to distinguish what is right and wrong. It is inevitable that some people will use information improperly. To cope with the problem, we should think more carefully before we adopt the suggestion, also, doing research can help us to ensure the suggestion is fine.With the right behavior, the times of receiving fake information will be reduced, social recommendation can benefit our life."
47,66,20170324,7,"It is amazing that iBeacon is using BLE to transfer information, while bluetooth is an existing technology with a long time. I can see how innovation changes the world. However, I agree that iBeacon have some limitations. The biggest weakness of iBeacon is that it only performs one-way communication, users can only receive the information from it, this is a lack of communication.So, the future step is to develop something to co-operate with iBeacon, so as to achieve a better interaction between human and information."
24,66,20170324,7,"It is undoubtedly that AI will play an important role in the future as it can help human to make decisions more efficiently. I am shocked when AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, the professional board player.However, some obstacles of AI have to be overcome first. Regarding a website about AI (http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/10/13224930/ai-deep-learning-limitations-drawbacks), it points out most of the today??s AI can only focus on one single task and their actions are somehow explainable, so the future tasks is to train AI to be more intelligent so as to handle multitask.I believe our life will be more wonderful with the continuous development of AI."
54,66,20170324,7,"I agree that online social network connects different people all around the world, so that people can easily exchange information with each other.However, it is easy to find out that some user comment with emoji only, i do think that this action can not facilitate human information interaction. In the lecture, we were taught to exercise the epistemic cognition so as to ensure good quality of the blog.So, I think we should adopt this attitude in other social network to achieve the highest level of collaborative knowledge construction, so that the quality of social network can be elevated. That would be much more meaningful."
61,66,20170324,7,"You have introduced different examples of smart city, by combining different IoT devices, all kind of data can be collected and analyzed. These technologies help us automate the city. Actually, there are six major fields in smart city posed by Boyd Cohen, they are Smart Economy (Business), Smart Environment (City planning), Smart People (Social network), Smart Mobility (Transportation) , Smart Living (Home) and Smart Government. The system and operation in these area are enhanced by IoT.I hope someday our city will become smarter, so that our living standard will be improved."
10,66,20170324,7,"Online shopping really brings convenience to us, we can easily purchase a product by just clicking a few buttons at home, this saves a lot time. However, there always a trade-off between fast and quality, as we can not try on the commodities, there are always cases that the product is in a wrong size, the color is not the same with the photo in the net, etc. This kind of issues may even waste more time for us to deal with the seller. So, we need to be careful while using such new way to buy things."
37,66,20170324,7,"I saw many posts about the MahJong Society in Facebook as well after your post had released. Your experience is a great example showing how social media help the spread of information among people. This is the power of technology which connect human and information.However somehow this may be a risk if the information is fake, there was a case that people buy all the salt in supermarket after the Japan earthquake, this is a case that show the improper use of social media, so we should be careful to all information received."
37,66,20170324,7,"Thank you for your work on showing how to perform social media analysis by Python program, the procedures are very clear so that i can follow your steps. However, as a player of Hearth Stone, the result is out of my expectation from what I expected are some words of the trending meta, for example ""reno"", ""jade"". The result may be more meaningful if the sample size increases. Anyway, I appreciate your study on twitter."

6,66,20170324,7,"Thank you for sharing some interesting sentences which contain several meanings when we read it in different perspective. Language is a sophisticated tool for human to communicate, it is hard for us to understand it deeply. As an engineering student, we may want to combine human language and computer analysis, in which we have sentiment analysis. It is interesting to know how will computer deal with these tricky sentences and how will an engineer handle it."
37,24,20170324,7,"Hi Luiyan, thank you for your sharing. I came across the news that you mentioned in your sharing earlier days as some of my friends commented on it, or shared it. In your case, I can see the rise of social media and why. In fact, I think spreading posts or articles on social media is quite similar as spreading the news through traditional media. Nowadays, we spread information by sharing it with our friends on social media. In the past, we spread information by telling friends directly. It all depends on sharing to our friends. Only that with the assistant of the advanced technology, information can be spread more swiftly and efficiently to a large group of people on social media, which users spend more time on than traditional media as you mentioned.The rise of social media provides a new way of promotion and arousing public concerns towards certain issues. However, I think it is hard for social media to take over traditional media completely at all in coming years. Perhaps for a certain kind of traditional media, for example, newspapers, it can be transformed into social media. However, for television, another kind of traditional media, it should still have its own market value with the different programs."
71,24,20170324,7,"Hi Trevor, I think you have made a good point with the example of Trump that social media can manipulate our thoughts with the preference system.With the rise of social media, it becomes a platform for publics to get in touch with the outside world. Scrolling down Facebook, ones can know how their friends are doing and get information on current affairs, entertainments etc. at the same time. It is very convenient and this makes we rely on social media more. However, what we don't know is that our data, for example, cookies, is collected. With big data and recommendation system that you mentioned, we are offered with posts or product promotions that match our preference. We thought we were able to see the whole picture through social media but as a matter of fact, we don't. We may not even be looking at half of it.With big data, social media is certainly a good tool for business that it can provide suggested products that users are interested in respectively. It saves users time from browsing varies of websites on their interested products. But at the same time, it limits the users to a smaller number of choices. Or just like what you said, that social media manipulates one's thought.Understanding the power of social media, I think it would be good for us to have multiple sources of information. Following different pages, which you suggested, is one way to do it. Or we can read different online news on our own, not relying on social media to tell us about the reality."
50,24,20170324,7,"I do agree that HII provides another way to understand and study different information. HII allows one understand one??s behavior. With HII, human behavior is more predictable by the calculation of probability as you have mentioned. Hence, with a better understanding of information, HII benefit us in developing more efficient systems. Other than communication system that you mentioned, other systems, like software system, shopping system, can also benefit from HII as a more user-oriented setting can be provided which boosts the performance and enhances the quality of the system.All in all, HII is important as it helps in understanding how human think and feel with information. It certainly benefits us in so many different ways."
13,24,20170324,7,"I totally agree that HII is a significant topic to study. HII enables us to have a better understanding of how human think and how they feel with information. With HII, human behavior is more predictable and that allows HII to has a close relationship with other fields, just like what you have mentioned, as it involves widely in different fields. Perhaps people in other fields, such as marketing, public relationships etc., should also know about HII as it is closely related to them. I also agree that as an information engineering student, apart from learning the techniques on processing data, understanding information from a human perspective can help in data analysis."
74,24,20170325,7,"I also think that recommendation systems are fascinating. As you said, the recommendation systems enable us to look for things that we are interested in faster and easier. For example, after watching a video on YouTube, there will be dozens of related video recommendations. They are either from the same producers, celebrities, programs or of the same category. You can spend days on YouTube without searching for a video on your own. Similar situation can also be found when you are shopping online. You can always see words like ""things you may like"", Recommendation systems undoubtedly bring us convenience. It also benefits the business sector to promote their products and to keep track on what consumers want to purchase. However, just like you mentioned, there maybe exchange of our information that we are not aware of. It is worth paying attention to the security problem and the privacy issues caused by recommendation systems."
71,24,20170325,7,"I can see your point on the possibility of simulating or predicting one's life in the future. I don??t think that it is impossible to do so, just that it would require a lot of information and that it would not be 100% accurate, though.There was an American drama series called ""numb3rs"". It is about how Charlie uses mathematics to help his brother Don in the solving the crime. I remember that there is one episode on solving bank robberies. Don and his colleagues in the FBI have been hunting the bank robbers who involve in 16 robberies. With the information on the 16 robberies, Charlie is able to develop an equation based on the distinct pattern of the robberies. The equation successfully predicts when and which bank the robbers will go to next. However, Don is not able to arrest the robbers due to the unexpected behavior of the robbers. Charlie explained, ""the observation of the robbers ultimately changes their behavior"". It is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.Though this is just a drama episode, it shows that it is not easy to predict human behavior and there is always uncertainty."
26,24,20170325,7,"Thank you for your sharing on different recommendation systems. I understand more on different recommendation systems with your examples. I agreed that the recommendation systems are very powerful. The wide application of recommendation systems makes online shopping more convenient and easier. It also provides a new way for us to get in touch with the numerous information. For example, when you watched a video about cooking on YouTube, many other cooking videos are recommended. It is not necessary for us to search for another cooking video again. Various information is provided in a short time.But at the same time, there are things that we should pay attention to. As you mentioned, data are collected from users to predict users' behavior. We should take proper measures to protect our data while enjoying the benefits from recommendation system."
48,24,20170325,7,"Indeed, the rise of social media leads to more occurrences of cyberbullying. It is free for everyone to say anything they want on social media. Despite there may be functions like ""report"" on Facebook to report abusive content, it is difficult to stop people from verbal violence. The unnecessity of being responsible for one's words is another reason accounts for cyberbullying.Apart from the increase numbers of cyberbullying, social media also affects decision making. People tend to seek for advice on social media nowadays. It is not a problem to ask for opinions. However, when it comes to social media, it is hard to verify one's comment. Sometimes there may be wrong or unreal information. The over-reliance on others' opinions is not desirable."
63,24,20170325,7,"I think it is essential to study semantic information. Different words have different meanings. A single word can as well have multiple meanings. By analyzing semantic information, we can better understand human behavior. However, before analyzing information, it is necessary for us to understand the information and perform content analysis.Content analysis is widely applied to different fields. Though content analysis is very common nowadays, the accuracy of content analysis is still a challenging problem. Even with the same sentence, different people can have different interpretations, depending on their ages, experience, education level etc. So, great effort is required for further development of content analysis."
55,24,20170325,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I think you have made a point that contextual computing will be the new trend in technology. However, there are plenty of improvements can be made before it becomes the dominant pattern.Contextual computing required real-time data, and also users' data like their preferences and different behaviors. One of the main concern of contextual computing is the privacy of users. It is difficult to protect the privacy of users while their data is used for computation. Users may not want to expose their information. For example, I always turn off the GPS function in my smartphone. I don't want GPS locating my whereabout every second. I think that if there is a leak of the GPS information, it is possible to find out my life pattern, or where I live, study or hang out just by analyzing the information. I feel insecure about GPS. I only turn it on when I need to use it. Contextual computing benefits our life in so many ways. It would be more assuring if the privacy of users can be protected with various measures."
48,24,20170325,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I think you did a great job in reminding us on the privacy and security problem on social media. As you mentioned that teens nowadays tend to share their personal information on social media, they leave their social media footprint without even aware of it. Perhaps you can delete the post or remove the tag later, you never know whether it really disappears.In fact, while we are enjoying the convenience come with social media, we are providing our information to the social media companies. Our preferences are exposed so that the companies can profit from the advertisements. Other than that, we also expose our phone number when we log in the social media platforms with it. Most people are inattentive to the privacy and security problems of social media. They should be aware of the privacy and security issues while enjoying the social media platforms."
55,24,20170325,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I think whether machines will replace human one day is a question that worth discuss.There is a critical difference in human and AIs, i.e., human have feelings while AIs don't. Also, AIs follow instructions and programs but human thinks and takes action on their own. So, I don't think machines can replace human.However, I think it is necessary for us to take precautions on AIs being too ""human"".There was a movie, named ""I, Robot"". In the movie, AIs are widely used and it is a great part of human's live. Human trusts the AIs and AIs are considered as their family. Spooner, a detective, is being hunted by a group of AIs while he is investigating a crime. Though it turns out the AIs are trying to save humans, it is still an alert to us."
55,24,20170325,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I do agree that technology has changed the way we learn. In the past, most people went to libraries to do research. Nowadays, most people do their research through the internet. Even if they need to look for a book, they may try to look for an e-version of it first.I think many of us have the experience of learning through the internet, asking questions on forums, watching YouTube video or Khan Academics, etc. Lecture notes and related materials are uploaded to eLearning and that many of us no longer print notes and write on it. We make notes on iPads, smartphones or notebooks.To me, all of these are just tools to make learning more productive and efficient. Digital learning cannot replace traditional learning. It only acts as an assistance that helps students to learn.But for learner that are not students anymore, I think digital learning serves as a new way for them to upgrade oneself."
50,24,20170325,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I don't deny that learning in the digital environment is more interesting. In fact, I enjoy learning in the digital environment. I often watch videos on YouTube so as to have a better understanding of the topics. I think that with the hundreds of materials on the internet, we can choose the one that suits one's learning pace and learning methods.Despite the benefits of learning in digital environment, I think the tradition learning is irreplaceable. Learning in schools involves more than just learning academic materials. We also learn our social skills, problem-solving skill while participating in extra-curriculum activities. Though digital environment may serve as a way of more effective, flexible learning, there are things that must be learnt in traditional learning."
37,24,20170325,7,"Thank you for your sharing. Indeed, it is essential for us to understand semantic information. I like your saying of ""if there is no Newton??s law, there will be no Albert Einstein??s relativity."" I remember that when I was small, I asked my friend that why ""A"" is ""A"" and why can't ""B"" be ""A"". It has been quite a long time ago but I don't know why I thought of it when I saw your line. I agree that written words are one of the important inventions. Without written words, it is difficult for us to pass messages and knowledge. Without written words, there would not be any studies, technology, just as you said."
28,24,20170326,7,"Technology is widely used in so many different fields nowadays. It is in very single part of our life. It brings convenience and makes our life easier. We work more productive and efficient with different equipment, devices, machines etc. It benefits us in so many ways.And for what you said that technology reduces the work opportunities, I won't deny it. However, there are also new work opportunities due to the technology, for example, engineers. So I think this is not a problem of technology.I think the problem of technology is that we rely on technology too much and also the privacy and security issues that come with technology."
74,47,20170322,7,"Yes, the use of human information interaction is surrounding us at every time and every place. Also, being an engineering student, we should broaden our mind and not limit ourselves in only considering what we learn on the lesson. Therefore, making use of the HII and observing our surroundings can help us to discover more idea of invention to improve our life."
74,47,20170322,7,"Recommendation systems give advantage to both consumer and business. They let user to find their favourite items on online shopping more easily and also give opportunity for company to sell their product. I think the key to make these systems work is the use of big data. Recommendation system cannot do its job without collecting sufficient data. Big data provides a large amount of user data, such as past purchases, browsing history and feedback, for the recommendation systems, so that they can provide relevant and effective recommendations. Therefore, although recommendation systems may rise security and privacy problem, it improves our online shopping experience. Recommendation systems will be more powerful when it make good use of the big data technology."
74,47,20170323,7,"You really give a great remind to us that considering User Experience (UX) design is important an engineer. To develop this kind of design, we can also look at the sub-systems and processes within a system. For example, studying the checkout process of an online shopping website to observe whether users find the process of buying goods on the website is easy and pleasant. By investigating deeper to the components of the sub-system, we can find out the method to fulfill experience of users. As a result, we can make a good UX design."
74,47,20170323,7,"Digital Cognition is getting important while people having more interaction with the computer world. As an engineering student, communicating with the Internet or the computer will not be a big problem. What we really need to do is to let the public who only have little computer knowledge or even do not know to use computer gain benefit from these technologies. The logic behind the technologies and the interface show to the public should be separated into two clearly so that users will not confuse with the technical problem."
20,47,20170324,7,"I agree that this course is very useful and interesting. As an engineering student, I mainly took the course about mathematics and programming from my year 1 to year 3. This course is a new topic to me that it teaches me the thing of interaction between computer and people. Besides, Professor always uses interactive examples on the class to show that day's lesson content to the student. It attracts me to think more about the meaning of the example. It is why I think the course is interesting."
50,47,20170324,7,"Undoubtedly, sentiment analysis is difficult to be performed by machines because there are so many ways to interpret one's meaning and the machines will make mistake if the interpretation is done wrongly. In order to improve the performance, big data technology can be used. With the help of big data, more language models can be constructed to interpret one's meaning more accurately. As a result, the machines will be more ""smart"" to interact with people and give a corresponding respond."
50,47,20170324,7,"I agree with you that applying the technology of machine learning into the educational area can benefit students a lot. One of the examples of applying machine learning into other field is the automatic translation on the online platforms. The algorithm using machine learning learn about how words fit together and translate more accurately. With the help from it, people can translate one language to another language easily without asking real people help. This kind of translation not only help students but also the other public to understand the article written in other languages. Therefore, machine learning really can benefit all walks of life."
4,47,20170324,7,"I agree with you that contextual computing is powerful. Without context, collected data is meaningless. As you say, the recommendation system using contextual computing. If the system only collects users?? choice to products may not be so much meaningful. However, if the system collects these data and analyses the linkage among different action of the user, it can provide an accurate suggestion. Besides using contextual computing to connect data and data, it also used to gather, reason and adapt data to make the data become meaningful information."
4,47,20170324,7,"I agree that satisficing is useful while we are facing a large amount of choice every day. As an engineering student, we should be aware of the user experience so that we can design a product really fit the user. For example, when we developing a website, we should write a simple interface rather than a complex one, thus more people are able to understand it and use it."
4,47,20170324,7,"Undoubtedly, sentiment analysis is useful when it applied into computer world to let machine become able to interpret people's expression meaning. As you say, there is a challenge in sentiment analysis that it may make mistake because there are so many ways to interpret one's meaning and thus the interpretation is done wrongly. In order to improve the performance, I think contextual computing and big data technology can be combined together and used. With the help of contextual computing, different parts of an article can be connected and environment of the article can be understood. Also, big data help to build more language models. Machines can interpret one's meaning more accurate and give a corresponding respond."
72,47,20170324,7,"I share your view that social cognition highly effects our daily life. As a university student, we should have critical thinking and make the decision by ourselves. For example, when we balance the time of study and joining the extra-curricular activity, we need do judgment by ourselves but not only listen to the peer. Even more, being an engineering student, we should observe the surroundings more in order to develop a design that fit people and improve their life."
72,47,20170324,7,"I see your point about context computing and you give good examples to show us the different sides of it. To prevent the risk of abusing personal information, I think companies should state clear what the usage of collected data will be and let the user decide to use it or not so that user will think twice before they use. Moreover, companies should increase the security in order to prevent users' information from being stolen. Nevertheless, applyingcontext computing into these kinds of system can make our daily issue more convenient and improve our life a lot. Therefore, I believe that the advantage of context computing is more than its disadvantage."
72,47,20170324,7,"I think your way to introduce the semantic function of program language is interesting. As an engineering student, we usually deal with the programming language. For myself, sometimes I need to use a difficult language I never learn to do assignments. At that moment, I always think about what if there is a kind of programming language that everybody can understand and learn how to use easily. As you say, different scenarios of semantics are being developed. If there is a day programming writing is not only can be done by programmers but all the public, I believe that the interaction between human and computer will be much more as I can image now."
40,47,20170324,7,"Undoubtedly, sentiment analysis is powerful to teach the machines to learn about human expression. However, as you say, it is difficult to be performed because there are so many ways to interpret one's meaning. For example, if I say, ""This book is extremely good!"", what I really mean maybe ""this book is bad"". In order to improve the accuracy, contextual computing, which is talked on the lesson, can be applied. With the help of it, collected data can be gathered to useful information. As a result, investigations like recommendation systems can be implemented."
65,54,20170322,7,"Thank you for giving a deep introduction to supervised learning. The example is very solid and easy to understand. In my opinion, machine learning will have an important role in the future. The machine learning technology has become more mature. For instance, AlphaGo has proven that machine can learn faster and deeper than human because of the difference in calculation ability. It is impossible for human to handle huge size of information in a short period of time. Computer can try as much possible cases and do simulations continuously while it cannot be done by human. If engineers can future explore more uses of machine learning in other aspect, it will do a great help to the technology development."
74,54,20170322,7,"I see the beauty of recommendation system too. However, I think that the recommendation system reveals the improper use of personal data from many website or company. As you mentioned that you never link your Facebook account to Rakuten but eventually Facebook has an advertisement for you about Rakuten. It shows that our data and searching habit leak out to the third party without our permission. Or sometimes this is because we agree to certain terms when we make use of certain services online like Google drive, gmail ,Skype etc. It is very often that users will not read those terms and agree it without reading carefully. Therefore, as a frequent user, we should be more careful to protect our privacy and be aware of the online security problem."
75,54,20170322,7,"I agree the point that graphic language can enhance communication between people. However, some people misuse and abuse the use of graphic language. Since people may have different interpretations on the same icon or image, it may cause misunderstanding and decrease in quality of communication. For instance, different people send text message using the same ??laugh cry?? emoji, but they may not have the same feeling or meaning to express. From this video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8tvHPpiQs, it is interesting to see that even couples misunderstand the meaning of the emoji from the text. Therefore, I think that we cannot only rely on graphic language to communicate. It can be a supplement but it should not be the main language to use."
63,54,20170322,7,"Thank you for clarifying the difference between human cognition and digital cognition. Machine learning is becoming more mature and well-developed than before and it shows its power in many aspects. However, even machine learning is powerful in many aspect, I think it cannot completely replace human and it may cause problem in implementation. There is a case that using AI to make decision may cause a philosophical dilemma. For a self-driving car system, if it faces an accident which cannot be avoided, it needs to make a choice between crashing one person or crashing 5 people. For a machine, it may make the ??rational"" choice to crash 1 person to save more people. In reality, a human may make another choice if the only person is his wife. It is a good question to think of where and when we should make use of the help of machine learning. It also worth our time to consider the future of machine learning."
76,54,20170323,7,"I agree that online shopping has changed people??s shopping habit and bring a lot of advantages to people. I think that the recommendation system in the online store is one of the key to make it successful. Since the recommendation system will suggest items according to the similarity of products, interests or habits of customers, it boots the sale and increases the incentive to buy for customers. It shows how technology helps boosting the economy of our society."
61,54,20170323,7,"I agree that our city is developing to a Smart City. More and more IOT and ICT related technology intruded into our daily life such as the smart phone, self-driving system, wireless control system etc. I do think that one day every person can have a personalized helper like Jarvis in the Iron Man, which help us to manage every things we want to do. The only challenge of making our city to become a Smart City is to reduce the cost of using the technology and make it common around the society."
66,54,20170323,7,"I see the point that recommendation system enhances HII. Nowadays, there are thousands of information received by us. We don??t want to read it all and want to find some useful or desired information. With the aid of recommendation system, we can have some screened information which is probably suiting our interests. For example, when we shop online, the recommendation system will show related product according to what we have searched. It saves a lot of times for us to find the product we want. This example shows the way that ecommendation system enhances HII."
25,54,20170323,7,"I also appreciate how VR technologies benefit our human??s life. However, I think that there are some challenges that VR technologies need to improve in order to make it more common and convenient to use. The device required is a problem that will hinder the development of VR technology. Since the head cam for playing VR is still too big, it is not convenient to use and user cannot keep using it for a long time. It is better if the device can have a better design. Also, from my personal experience, people may not feel comfortable and may have headache when using VR. These are the points that the developer of VR tech can put more concern on."
21,54,20170323,7,"I concede that machine learning benefits us in many ways. However, there are some problems raised. By using your example, you have mentioned that company can use machine learning to help making decision. It is a good choice if we have enough information provided to the database. If we don??t have enough data provided to the calculation, the output result may not be right or optimal. If the company followed the wrong prediction, it may cause loss to the company. Therefore, even machine learning is widely used nowadays and become more mature than before, there is still a long way to develop for this technology."
41,54,20170323,7,"I like your solid example. It is common to have misunderstanding on sentimental information. As I think that sentimental information is very complicated and can have different interpretation when different people perceive it, computer cannot handle complex sentimental information compared to human. Computer can only handle simple sentimental information like the overall optimist of people on certain event but not the actual emotion of human."
51,54,20170323,7,"I agree the importance of text language. Nowadays, many people use graphic language to replace text language. For instance, people use emoji frequently in instant messaging. However, it causes misunderstanding very often since different people may have different interpretation on the same icon. Therefore, we cannot neglect the importance of text language."
5,54,20170323,7,"I am in consensus with your opinion. There is a common saying ?????D??????"", which means you will know the truth when you see the photo. However, I think this saying is only partial correct. We cannot believe in a topic only by semantic information. It??s very often that photo and graphic can only present part of the truth. The method of presentation of a photo will also affect people??s view. Therefore, we cannot judge a book by its cover by graphic. We should judge after we have more complete information."
65,54,20170323,7,"Thank you for sharing the programming behind recommendation system. It is always good to learn how to implement the concept to a real product. This skill is very useful since it can apply to many other ways. For example, we can use the rating of customers on certain products to predict what product people like most. As time past, we can have more idea on what people like so as to set up the selling strategy. All in all, the recommendation system is very useful and powerful."
61,67,20170324,7,"As you mentioned about the data compression, i would like to discuss more about it. In information theory, data compression can be done by two ways, lossy compression and lossless compression. Depends on what outcome is desired, integrity or compression efficiency, different method would be taken. Lossless compression consider the integrity of the data so that it can be conversed to result the As you mentioned about the data compression, i would like to discuss more about it. In information theory, data compression can be done by two ways, lossy compression and lossless compression. Depends on what outcome is desired, integrity or compression efficiency, different method would be taken. Lossless compression consider the integrity of the data so that it can be conversed to result the original file. However, the file size would not be reduced significantly because of the protection of integrity. In fact, some of the data loss is acceptable. For example, a very high quality picture that the detail could not be distinguished by our sight. In these case, people would try to reduce the file size in different method, may be combining several pixels into one in the picture or video. Therefore, the file size would be reduced significantly and the cost would be not able to converse the compression. In our daily life, both method would be used, zip, png and gif are applying lossless compression whether jpeg and mp3 are applying lossy compression."
16,67,20170324,7,"AR and VR are actually an interesting topic. However I concern the problem that the development of AR and VR. Augmented Reality enhances the our feeling with the information updated by reality facts. Although the empathy increases when the supplementary information becomes more comprehensive, People can still easily distinguish AR and actual world. Pokemon Go would be a good example to show us AR cannot replace the original world. That??s the problem augmented reality facing.VR is another idea that solves the problem. When we experience the virtual reality, we just like jumping into a new world that we would be able to sense our sight, hearing and even hypogravic. But the VR experience would make people feel vertigo or vomit. That would be another problem that development of VR have to improve the discomfort experience."
36,67,20170324,7,"It would be a big concern that machine is going to replace human. From the transformation of industry in Hong Kong. We can observe that the repeating procedures can be replaced by robots easily. That??s why handicraft industry is moving out from Hong Kong. It forces us to change our value to use our brain. However, machine learning is another contest to threaten the value of our thinking. Computer can actually think with a enough amount of data sample. With machine learning, computer can give solution by previous knowledge or history and only the knowledge from the database. Creativity is the key things that machine learning cannot provide. So we should move to use our creativity to show the value of us that cannot be replaced by robots."
67,67,20170324,7,"Yes, it is actually the way we try to communicate with foreigner, right? When we cannot speak fluent language in other country, we would try to express what we need in body language and hand gesture. It is the example to make the information comprehensive with physical and semantic information. Even we are able to talk with the same language, we usually express ourselves with semantic information for a better understanding;)"
36,67,20170325,7,"I like your example of facial recognition. It helps not only the focus of camera, but also helps in security system that helps police to arrest the criminal recorded by CCTVs. Actually this technology is widely used in Hong Kong. It is easily to find a news that applying the technology i mentioned. I show you a link for reference. http://news.mingpao.com/pns/dailynews/web_tc/article/20160830/s00002/1472493694752However, as an engineer, we should also face the potential problem that machine learning would face. For example, privacy, or replacement of human, these would be a big concern to determine the rights and the values between human and machine. There are some classmate also discussing similar ideas. You can click the link below for further information."
67,67,20170325,7,"I like your point about misusing technology. In our experience, our relatives use their phone for entertainment and ignore the surroundings. It is a kind of disrespect and it is a trend of the new ages. Nowadays, parents should avoid using electronic gadgets when they are taking care of their children. The addiction of electronic gadgets is always started from the laziness of parents. They think an ipad could satisfy their kids and they can release themselves from parenting. It is totally wrong!!Furthermore, I suggest you to watch an advertisement from Thailand which is talking about this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYCI1Htm0AU"
74,67,20170325,7,"I am glad to see another discussion about machine learning. I would like to raise a question that what should we do against the replacement of human by deep-learning machine?I have been mentioned this idea in other blogs. In my opinion, I think machine learning only gives a method to analyze the situation and giving a solution among that. However, it is restricted by the facts happen, no new ideas would be raised. In other term, it is lack of creativity that machine learning cannot overcome with. What do you think about it?"
9,67,20170325,7,"i would like to provide some supplementary information that the method to distinguish an emoji by computer is resulted by machine learning. The coordinate plane that you mentioned is actually an example of a database of machine learning. For each time computer tries to distinguish a face, it would search similar component in its database and provide a solution that suits as many as possible to the image scanned. It is the way how a computer knows you are smiling."
37,67,20170325,7,"I think the computer would be able to distinguish the face moreaccurately with enlarging the amount of data in the database. If the size of data is huge, then the computer would be able to determine more details on our faces, even a wrinkle or a movement of muscle. Actually, the computer could ??see"" more accurately than us with a huge database!"
56,67,20170325,7,"It is nice to suggest other popular social media platforms. There are some more example for your reference, Google Plus ,Weibo and 9gag. Please don't think that Weibo is only popular in mainland china. It is almost famous in America. There are over than 10k american users are using Weibo! For more interesting information, the sharing platform 9gag is written by HongKong Engineer! However, it is not very famous in Hong Kong when the website is launched. The trend turns back to Hong Kong after 6-8 years. Actually 9gag is launched before Facebook! What a encouraging news!"
50,67,20170324,7,"Hi, i would like to provide some supplementary information here. As you mentioned above, there are too much proverbs and negated meanings that makes misunderstanding. I would like to raise an idea that semantic information is actually a role of supplementary information. It helps us to understand the meaning of words and the images or icons should be easy to understand and some physical information should be provided besides it to avoid misunderstanding. There are no such way to express the information that having no disadvantage. We should use multiple ways to express an information to make sure they covers others disadvantages."
73,67,20170325,7,"The situational awareness service has been well developed. It is very important in commercial success not in the future, but now! For example, the famous snacks store, 759, has already been using this service to decide what snacks and where to put their snacks in stack to achieve optimal sales. This technology comes to a climax when Alphago beats world-class Chinese chess players, who have to decide actively according to different situation in the game. However, the recent advancement in this area of technology boils down to an important question: will artificial intelligence replaces us? I think it is high time to think what would be the value of human in the future when most of the tasks can be done by computers."
48,67,20170325,7,"Cyber security is a heated topic for these few years. This problem comes to a climax when Edward Snowden, a former US agency escape from the US and revealed that the US government had been conducting a world-wide surveillance program. Nearly everyone in the America and even foreign political leaders were spied. Honestly, I have lost faith on any means of cyber security already. It is one thing when there are hackers around the world to steal your information or commercial company selling your data away. It is totally a different story when the leading government in the world is doing that also. At this point, I think the only way to keep your personal information secret is never put the highly private information in any electronic gadget that can access the internet."
48,67,20170325,7,"Thank you for raising this problem. The cyber-bullying issue is heated again when some supporters of John Tsang, a chief executive candidates, attacked Siu Fung Fung, a famous artists and a supported of Carrie Lam, in the internet. It has been proven that this kind of internet bullying can do actually harm to people psychologically. There are even cases that some people commit suicuide because of it. Despite the seriousness and prominence of the situation, little if not none, of the bullies are punished or sued. I think the government should proposed to establish new laws and new teams for this problem. Some people should be punished under the legal system in order to rectify the situation."
69,67,20170325,7,"Social media plays a pivotal role in society nowadays. Apart from your example of gay and lex marriage, the social media also facilitates political activities in Hong Kong. Thousands of protestors joined the occupy central movement three years ago in response to the calling in social media. Chief Executive candidates make use of social media to promote their political view, attract supporters and update their most recent activities. In my opinion, social media is the key to foster more and more youngsters participating in local politics in Hong Kong.However, social media also promotes activities that are detrimental to society. Terrorists groups, like ISIS, recruit members internationally through social media. Even European government cannot stops their citizens joining ISIS as they can??t prevent their citizens accessing ISIS in the internet.Therefore, while we are enjoying the convenience of social media, we should also come up with preventive measures to reduce the risks it bringing to us."

It is a tiny ring wearing at fingers and it provides a service to store personal information. One of the function of Kerv is monitoring personal transportation in Kerv. With its application in smartphone, you are able to plan your shortest path or cheapest path to your desired location and you are able to make a payment with Kerv rings. It has the function that similar to octopus in Hong Kong. Moreover, it can also be customized to use NFC lock authorization, such as the door lock in our IE lab!"
27,33,20170322,7,"You have showed us a real good example to prove sentiment analysis is important to us. The users feedback really made a great contribution to the game developers to debug and made it more user friendly. We can see the advantages not only for a commercial company and customers but also in different aspects of our society. For example, Nowadays many pilots in different countries like to study their Facebook comments to know more about people from different class, the listen to citizens ?? sound. It is really good to make our country and society better."
27,33,20170323,7,"I tally agree your words about the pros and cons of too much social recommendation. I think the pros is the opportunity and the cons is the challenge to us. Just like the example you show me, when you have no idea where to go or eat or movie to watch, you can just easily choose a higher rating stuff or follow their recommendation, we have more options to choose but it also requires a higher ability for us to choose the one which suit us best. Therefore, what we need to do living in the digital environment is to be more careful when facing different kinds of information and more intelligent before making a decision."
27,33,20170323,7,"There is no doubt that, as an information engineer student, the information interruption can not only bring us the knowledge we need, but also provides us a lot of job opportunities. As we can proudly say that we are the professional people in this industry after we gain enough knowledge and experience. Therefore I really appreciate your analogy in your conclusion. ??as an information engineering student, we just like an architect of a bridge between machine and human. Allowing the information can transmit accurately and successfully between them."" This is quiet apropos. And it is the mission of us, to make the world more convenient"
52,33,20170323,7,"I think you have shown me a really good example for me to understand what is two main ways for the machine to learn, which is supervised learning or unsupervised learning, you regard the machine as a child. I totally agree that in today??s information world, the only method for us to let the machine learn is Supervised Learning, to give a dataset to the machine and help it to classify which words are positive or negative. However, I do not think this way is better than unsupervised learning, as we still cannot give machine enough capacity to have a better understanding on human, this is what we need to put effort on."
52,33,20170323,7,"I think in today??s society, semantic information has a more important function is to build up a bridge between human and digital information, to let the machine know our instruction and do what we want them to do. For example, in a program language like C, the statement are made up by some semantic sign like int, if, while, this is another kind of meaning to the computer. However, this kind of communication between human and machine is still too inflexible. The concept of NPL is to develop this kind of situation, to let the machines know us more, to give machine ??life??. I regarded it as a direction of us as an information engineer should put effort to follow."
52,33,20170323,7,"People cannot live without information and there is no doubt that technology have made a great contribution to the development of information interruption. And I really agree your words that ??the foundation of information is actually ourselves??. Nowadays we can easily list some new technology that drive the transmission of information based on our need and make our life more convenient. For example the most popular apps about catering, OpenRice. This app has showed us the detail information in different types of restaurants for people to discover delicious food easier. I also agree that ??some developer nowadays are just blindly developing new technologies??. It is really important for us as an information engineer student to combined modes and layers of information to develop technologies."
52,33,20170323,7,"I agree that we are living in a generation which is called ??information explosion??. I think too much information is both opportunity and challenge for us. Just like we are shopping in a big shopping mall and there are various kinds of goods for us choose, we have more options to choose but it also requires a higher ability for us to choose the one which suit us best. As a teenager, it is easy for us to be effected by the various kinds of information when making decisions as we not mature enough. Therefore, what we need to do living in the digital environment is to be more careful when facing different kinds of information and more intelligent before making a decision."
35,33,20170324,7,"You have showed us about the relationship between human and information and how human-being percept information. It is not only use our personal sense but also different kinds of technologies developed by the scientists nowadays. That is really a interesting topic, as we know we still have millions of matter have not been discovered, which is not only in the earth but also the universe . Your have take one of the examples which is the dark matter. Scientists are always keen on discovering a new star for human to live or to see whether there are extra-terrestrial in the universe. This is all called the information and we should put effort to discover"
35,33,20170324,7,"After reading your explanation of human Information Interaction, I have a deeper understanding about it, as you have showed three kinds of the procession of information exchange and list some examples of machine to make it easier to understand. I also agree that ??sine noise affect the information during translation??, is critical point for engineering student to concern about. And I think one more thing we need to concern about is the safety of our personal information through the procession of information exchange. As nowadays the social media become more and more powerful, it is easy for our personal information like ID number, photos and bank account to be stolen in a illegal using way. We need to concern more about it."
35,33,20170324,7,"I think you have showed a deep understanding at the meaning of sentiment analysis. It is true that this kind of technology make a great contribution all over the world in various aspect. For example, people lie to shopping online nowadays by using Tao Bao, before making a decision buying something, you can view the comments to decide which is better. And there is some sentiment analysis work on the comment provided by the website to produce a rating for customers to consider. The owner of the shop can also see the weakness of their shop to improve. That is a win-win policy. And I also agree that you words ??Metaphor is one of issues which is hard for sentiment classification to process with??, that is true that, there still are some difficulties we cannot overcome, and that are which we need to study."
48,33,20170324,7,"I think you have really take am important point for me. In the class we only thought about how the social media and the information interruption benefit to us, we have not discuss or consider about the drawback. Your post really made me reflect on it. And I think the drawback is not only you said in the post, the cyberbullying is another serious problem among teenagers in Hong Kong??s society.As the function of social media becoming stronger and stronger. We can usually see some people post some other people??s privacy to produce public opinion, which make a hardly stress on the party. Some of the parties even commit suicide. Therefore, it is really important for government to supervise the social media."
26,33,20170324,7,"I think you really showed me a very detail description of recommend system, not only its function and its advantages. There is no doubt that this kinds of system really benefit to us in different aspect, for example we can search some movie comments for consideration before we getting into the cinema, and we can also study the comments before we buying something in Tao Bao online shopping. However, nowadays the recommend system has been illegal used by some company, they want more people to buy their products, they find people to post some fake comments to confuse the customers. I think that is what we need to be more careful in the digital environment."
4,33,20170324,7,"I think you have some us the detail description of what is sentiment analysis and how it benefit to us. There is no doubt that this kind of technology make a great contribution all over the world in various aspect. For example, Macdonald??s might find that their consumers are ranting more and more about chicken nuggets or their fries but are praising the new released bun. They can use this information to act accordingly. Maybe improve the taste on nuggets and fries or even raising the price of the bun to increase profit. And I also agree that ????sentiment analysis can still have its limitation is that some sentiments or opinions cannot simply be extracted by sentence extension and stop-word substitution.????? like metaphor is one of issues which is hard for sentiment classification to process with, there still are some difficulties we cannot overcome, and that are which we need to study."
21,23,20170324,7,"Social Networking Site really has its pros and cons. Social Networking Site is another reality but a virtual one. It provides another platform for us to face and link with others. As you said, social networking site can exchange users?? idea but also encourage the spread of fake news. In fact, this can happen everywhere. So the main concern is what has been commonly discussed before - how the users make use of Social Networking Site."
3,23,20170324,7,"Body language is really an important part for analyzing a person and knowing what the person is thinking. Sometimes it is more effective than analyzing one??s words. A common example is that one??s feet is pointing to the door. Even though there is no obvious signal about his impatience from his words, you can tell he is going to leave the room by his physical body language."
3,23,20170324,7,"I also agree with you that we should be careful about our body language. One of the examples is that expressing a number ??three?? with your fingers. If you hold your thumb and pinky together first and then ??stick?? the other three fingers with your thumb and pinky, it is a kind of impoliteness in some countries. So we have to think carefully."
46,23,20170324,7,"I agree that we link the function and meaning of something to our body whenever we know something new. In some courses teaching how to memorize things, linking different objects by its functions is one of the methods. There is also a terms ??body memory??. It seems similar to what your mentioned. A well-known statement is ??even we forgot something, our body still remember it??. Do you believe it?"
50,23,20170324,7,"After reading your post, I realize our learning method has changed a lot when compared to Secondary school. As college students, we rely much on the social media. Besides the discussion pattern you mentioned, we get most of the resources from the Net. Searching thesis, searching examples?? And as an engineering student, may be get inspirations via the social media."
37,71,20170322,7,"Hi Lui, thanks for your sharing, it??s good to know how you use social media to draw attention from the public. I read the article on your personal Facebook page as well. There is a question pop up from my head ?C what??s the sociality of your Facebook account or the Facebook page of Mahjong society? From the class, Professor Chan mentioned that social media occupies a wide spectrum between public broadcast and private dyad. For the Facebook page of Mahjong society, it probably leans toward the public broadcast as the target audience is the general public. Online media like ????01 can gather information from it; but for your personal Facebook page, I think it leans toward the private dyad as only your friends can view your posts."
37,71,20170322,7,"The development of contextual computing could turn AI mroe 'human'. AI has long be blamed for it's cold-hearted, rational and unemotional natures as they cannot give a proper response to human. For example, they do not know how to comfort people when they feel sad. The root of the problem is that AI does not have understanding the interaction between agent and subject under. Considering the fact that AI has memory but not emotion at the very beginning, information engineer can create millions of agent and subject under millions of different circumstances, the corresponding understanding in these context should be created as well. They can then be stored in to the AI. If the AI is in similar context next time, it can react properly."
37,71,20170322,7,"I love your battery example which explains the concept of semantic information clearly. Understanding the concept ??semantic information?? is a key to know how human being process symbols or texts. But why should we learn about the way that human being process symbols/ texts? Because we want the digital products more user-friendly, so we need to know how human use them. User experience design focuses on human, it is necessary for us to know how does human being perceive language or semantic information. Think about an app, you as a user, would you enjoy using an app which is full of text? Probably not. That??s why app developer tries to use symbols to show semantic information. Symbols and graphic information are more intuitive to human being, so they are widely used in UX design."
5,71,20170322,7,"That??s quite an in-depth analysis LOL In the past, the society relies on newspaper to report the news; individuals rely on phone or pigeon to deliver personal message; but now, as you said, we rely on social media to deliver both news story and personal story. The rise of social media changes the way that we communicate completely. It's no longer human ?C human, but human ?C machine ?C human. Machine acts as an information exchange centre which collects data from us every single day. To make good use of the vast amount data, computers are used to analyze the big data. But before that, we need to understand how human being perceives, manipulates, interprets and releases information and train the computer to do the same job. This leads to the emerge of IE and this course. Hopefully, I??d understand the influence and application of social media and the information mined from it."
5,71,20170323,7,"Thank you Edward. The way that government official uses Facebook is quite different from how normal people do. I went to the HKPF Facebook page and the comments under the statuses are not so nice, really. Some users commented by saying ??HKPF is so poor??, whilst others agree with that and blame the HKPF together. The phenomenon reminds me of Reciprocal Determinism. A person??s behavior and the social environment are mutually influencing each other. The posted negative comment there attract other users express similar option. Also, the comment itself also influences others beliefs on HKPF. That could be a vicious cycle: More people post negative comment on it, more people read it and more people are influenced and develop negative thought regarding HKPF."
5,71,20170323,7,"Edward, I??m so glad that you??re trying to apply what you learnt in this course to solve the current social issue. Your question: ??I hope that to find out the relationship of using Social Media and how does it reduce the social conflicts in the public?? draws my attention. Recalled from the lecture, assimilation and problem-based discussion help with collaborative knowledge construction. The former one is passive as discussion participants take in peer??s response to their beliefs in order to minimize the differences arising from discussion. The latter one is an active approach. Discussion participants look for explanation when new views or new information come to them. I think both ways of knowledge construction can minimise conflict in social media as the users are more likely to assimilate peer response to their own thoughts. Also, the misunderstanding is less likely happen as problem-based discussions encourages explanation."
37,71,20170323,7,"Hi Lui. Thank you for your explanation on Similarity measures. ??How does computer view things??? is a fascinating topic. Computer sees things differently from human being as digital cognition is completely opposite to human cognition. Human agents start from embodiment to abstraction whilst digital agents start from abstraction to embodiment. Computer tends to apply mathematics like vector space model and cosine similarity to differentiate 2 objects. Honestly, it??s a clever way to do so, but I think the key challenge is that how to set up the parameters. In the smiling face case, the parameters are the curvature of month and eyes. But what if I want to write an algo to differentiate human being and animals? The parameters could be the number of legs, hands and the size of body. But under these three parameters, monkey is very likely to be classified as human being which is not true. What I want to bring up from this example is that, the parameters are required to be set carefully, otherwise, the computer would not be able to differentiate similar objects."
24,71,20170324,7,"Thank you for your sharing. It??s nice to see you associate AI with the concept we learnt in class. As our world is getting more and more digitalized, it is expected that the boundaries of physical information, semantic information and digital information will fade out. Digital information can be semantic information at the same time. For example, the IP address your computer. It??s a string of number, which is a piece of semantic information. But at the same time, it is a piece of digital information and it can be entered into some software and be translated into a location in a domain."
5,71,20170324,7,"Edward, thank you for your sharing regarding the use of visual information and it is inspiring. Generally speaking, I think visual information is more intuitive and easier to grasp. It allows us to work with the concepts symbolically. To name just a few, we use a camera icon rather than the word ??Camera?? to represent the photo taking function in iPhone; we use a timer icon instead of the word ??timer?? to show the time counting function.Due to the intuitive nature of the visual information, pictures are widely used in social media to share message. The existence of social media actually speeds up the picture spreading process. A 9gag picture can be shared a million times within a day through facebook. Visual information makes the idea exchange easier and faster in social network."
70,71,20170324,7,"Hey Ken, this is the first blog I read which associates digital environment with programming education. You mentioned the well-defined tag name from ??HTML Element Reference?? as you think that may help junior programmer to learner. I partly agree with that as the definition of the tag is clear and can be easily applied. But I have another idea, could we use icon to program? Say we put a book icon at the beginning of program to replace ??# include dictionary??. Would it be even more intuitive and easy to understand? Haha From Chapter 6 of the course, we learnt that graphic information is also semantic and it??s easier to grasp. Writing programme by using icon/ symbols could be easy and fun. I??m looking forward to the icon programming! LOL"
70,71,20170324,7,"Ken, I can tell that you take this course incredibly serious. This is the first blog post you wrote in this course and you mentioned the concept ??information seeking??. I??m surprised as it??s a concept in chapter 8.I would like to add one point here explaining the concept ??Information seeking??. Human being seeks information in a similar way as other animals forage for food. The Information Foraging Theory states that people will modify their strategies or the structure of the environment to maximize their rate of gaining valuable information.So what??s your strategy to maximize the information you receive in this course?"
70,71,20170324,7,"Ken, I appreciate that you applied what you learnt in the class on a new subject: Human-Robert interaction. I agree with you that human being is likely to treat the robot as another human being. Let??s think about, if you buy a AI robot in the future, would you spend time to train it up or you want it to serve you well without any training? Of course, you want it ready to serve once you buy it. Human being is satisficing, we act based on the most obvious information available and with little concentration possible. The UX designers play an important role to make a robot easier to use."
46,71,20170324,7,"Mercus, the content we learnt in week 7 and 8 is so interesting. I??m not surprised when know there??s something called human cognition but it??s a bit of shock to know digital agents have their digital cognition. Although human cognition and digital cognition are both cognition, they process in a complete different ways. Human agents go all the way up from embodiment to abstraction while digital agents go all the way down from abstraction to embodiment.Also, I find the cosine similarity approach is fascinating! I??ve never thought of smiling faces could be expressed by vectors! This approach can be used to solve different problems. I was wondering Veriguide may use similar measures to detect plagiarism haha"
74,71,20170324,7,"Sze, thanks for your insightful opinion. You spoke my mind, really. Let??s take a close look at what information engineer do. We write apps as we believe that apps make people??s lives easier; we took product design course as we need to develop our design mindsets, which help us to produce sensible and functional products to solve our client??s needs. At the end of the day, we are here to apply technologies to serve people??s need. At the information era, information is everywhere. Making good use of these information can improve our living standard. The key question is how should we apply the information and make it more accessible to human being? This course is made to answer the question. By carrying out sentiment analysis and social network analysis, I believe that we will have a better understanding on how those information is generated and the implication behind it. More importantly, we??d be able to understand how information in social network pose impact in our real lives."
8,71,20170324,7,"Hi Alex, thanks you for analysis. I think another great differences between machine and human being are creativity and visualization. Let me put in this way, if I ask you to describe your dream room immediately, I think there will be a picture pop up in your mind and you can describe it to me verbally. But what if I ask the same question to an AI? It probably can't come up with any dream room design. Designing or imagining a dream room requires perception cognition experience, which is difficult to a computer. What a computer can do is playing vectors. So if we really want a computer to design a room for us, we can offer a set of vectors representing different furniture and let the computer combine the vectors to form a room for us."
8,71,20170324,7,"Information entropy is quite a new concept to me. I??ve never thought the information content can be measured. For the same piece of information, it has different amount of information content depending on who is reading the information. The more you know about the subject before reading that piece of information, the lower the content of that piece of information is to you. The information entropy of a piece of information is not universal but vary from different viewers."
12,56,20170323,7,Machine learning is an interesting and definitely one of the biggest innovation in our generation. Last year Google??s AlphaGo let the world know the power of machine learning. I can??t wait to see more advancement in this area.
12,56,20170324,7,Human interaction is definitely an interesting topic to discuss more on. The way that we can understand different classmates ideas is very useful. Great article!
12,56,20170324,7,"There are definitely some risks using social media. Everyone can share news and they spread quickly. But there is no good measures to verify these information. And therefore people with bad intention can spread frauds and fake news with social media, causing public panic and other side effects."
12,56,20170324,7,"Yes indeed once we agree on the policy terms on various sites like Fcaebook, it is very likely that we agreed on allowing these sites to collect our data including surfing habits. Recommendations can be convenient but we should always be vigilant on protecting our privacy."
29,56,20170324,7,That is a very interesting point that users reaction and interaction contributes on building websites.
29,56,20170324,7,Good points made in the article. The fact that people are still rely on the most instinctive way of communication which is verbal communication. We still talk to people face-to-face and by phone. Maybe social media let us have some alternatives to communicate but the old way is still irreplaceable.
16,56,20170324,7,I think recommends are computed by collecting user??s surfing history. Users gain some kinds of convenience by receiving some more personally interested information but at the cost of privacy exposed to these websites.
69,56,20170324,7,"Naive Bayes Test Classification is still the simplest and one of the best method to use despite its flaw. The reasons behind is that the algorithm is so simple to understand and apply in most situations. As for your examples on combined words and becoming a negative results, i.e. you like A and B but you don??t like A and B together, I think using exceptions can be an easy way to solve such problem."
69,56,20170324,7,"I love the reference of the gay marriage profile picture phenomenum which swept Facebook with a flood of rainbow colours. So informations spread instantly on social media and with that people are willingly share their thoughts and opinions, social interactions are becoming so complicated and a sophisticated subject these day."
69,56,20170324,7,"I love that lecture letting us going outside and do something different. Taking pictures and learning the subject of context is a very interactive and fun process. From ourselves, the agent, to discover the objects around us. This is just a good kind of lecture activities."
69,56,20170324,7,"UX is definitely a huge part of any apps and websites these days. From the responsivenes or the layout??s aesthetics, users are going to continue using the app or not by these instinctive criteria. Like Apple??s iOS is the prime example of easy to use and great UX, even elderly people who hasn??t use a computer could easily adapt to that because of good UX design."
3,56,20170324,7,The first I think of with NLP is Apple??s Siri. It??s not the first voice AI ever but the first to be fully function and sounds natural. Why? Because Siri is using NLP and other linguistic analytics to understand human speech. And NLP;s usage in healthcare could be the next big thing in the medical world. I am looking forward to the advancement in NLP and its application on various fields.
3,56,20170324,7,"That is a new kind of interpretation of information. But can information be consumed and used like energy? I think it can, that's why information analytics is all about. The recommend section of Facebook and internet ads make use of your online habit to provide the content most suited for you. As such, I kind of agree with you. Great article."
3,56,20170324,7,Body language is a very interesting topic and the differences of culture that causes misunderstandings are typical on intercultural communications. But internet is breaking many culture barriers. So how long could it takes to break the difference of body language? English is kind of breaking that and becoming a world common language. That could be very interesting to study about.
67,56,20170324,7,"First of all Arrival is one of the most thought-provoking film in recent years. The film is perfect for interpreting the way communication works, is to find a common ground of both sides. Like Abbott and Costello is using the squid words and Dr. Banks using the whiteboard to communicate. They both tried to let other to understand and come to a common ground where they can finally understand each other and truly exchange informations."
61,56,20170324,7,The most important thing of IoT and smart city is the use of human information. The system has to make use of data collected and turn into some application. Like I saw a simple IoT devices somewhere which is a smart umbrella holder using the weather forecast to remind the user to bring umbrella. It is the weather forecast to make the application possible. So put information to good use could greatly improve our lives and a giant leap towards a true smart city.
2,50,20170322,7,"Amazon Go is surely a very helpful application. It gives us a quicker and freer shopping experience. Modern people are busy with jobs and personal life where they rather spend time relaxing more than shopping. While Amazon Go catches the needs of people and develop this application so that we can shop without going out and reducing checkout time. Moreover, it can predict the things we are interested and gives an even more personal shopping experience to us.However, the privacy is another problem that comes along. As the application can access consumers?? information, if there is hacker, the privacy of customers may not be protected."
48,50,20170322,7,"Thank you for your sharing. Your blog post has reminded me of the phone call fraud problem in Hong Kong. In these years, this problem has become more serious. On average, every one has received at least one of these phone calls. People can access others?? personal information from the Internet. As the above comments have mentioned, one of the most common examples is Facebook. Users have always thought it is a safe platform to share information and feelings. However, Internet is open to people all around the world. It is very easy and convenient to access information in the Internet. Therefore, when we publish our information to the Internet, it is accessible to people all around the world. In the past, I was not aware of this since I thought there is no benefit for people who access my information. However, after different accidents in the society such as the phone call fraud and companies selling customers?? personal data for interest, I started to aware that we should have a higher sense to protect ourselves in the Internet. For example, we should not post any thing personal to the Internet, or at least share in a platform that is not public to everyone. Advanced technology has surely provided us a better life. However, we should also be aware of the safety problem it poses."
48,50,20170322,7,"You have mentioned about the drawbacks of social media on teenagers. First is that the subjective opinions shared may lead to misunderstanding of readers to the corresponding event. Like you have quoted, people share their views on political issues, but their words may not be all right. This may lead the readers to a wrong understanding to the readers. Second, as people can speak freely in the Internet, and it will not cause physical harm. Therefore, people may hurt other people??s feelings when speaking in the Internet. However, despite the drawbacks it draws, I think there are many advantages we can gain from social media. The most important thing is that we should not only rely on one source. Since the Internet may not always be accurate, therefore, we should read more from other sources, so that we can gain a more objective understanding to the issue we are concerned. This can be an advantage to us since we can hear the voices from many perspectives thus gaining a more comprehensive understanding."
69,50,20170322,7,"Thank you for your sharing. You have reminded us how social networks have connected people around the world together and shortened the physical distance between us. I particularly agree that ??social network links people with common interests together??. It reminds me of the small online business that is very popular nowadays. It is especially important to youngsters at our age that share the same interest. People love fashion can start up an online shop in the Instagram. They chose clothes they love and share it via the social network. It then attracts people who have the same taste and may purchase their products. Besides, social network is a great platform to share our interest. For example, some people will post video about singing and dancing on social media. Some even got famous as they gain more and more followers. Therefore, I do agree that social network is very useful when it comes to sharing interest and link people together."
76,50,20170323,7,"Yes, you are right. Online shopping really gives a new sensation of purchasing. It really gives many advantages. To me, the most attractive one is that we don??t need to go out to shop. Instead, we can shop whenever and wherever we want. In traditional shopping, we only visit one place. Even in the busiest place such as Mongkok, we can only visit a few shops at a time. However, in the Internet, we can visit unlimited online shops at one time. The convenience it brings is really a breakthrough.Another advantage I would like to raise is that online shopping has removed the barrier between countries. In the past, we can hardly purchase goods from foreign countries or it is not popular to do so. However, with online shopping, we can easily visit shops from all over the world and have much more choices. Most of the famous shops can allow a low shipping fee, some even provide free shipping."
19,50,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. You have mentioned the use of emoji and I definitely like this way of communication. It is an easy-understanding language. As you have said ??This kind of information can be directly interpreted by us even though no one has explained it to us.?? Emoji is a kind of language that no one needs to learn before using it. Though some may say that emoji sometimes is not easy to understand. Like Kristawwn has mentioned, boys and girls may interpret the emoji differently. However, I think traditional communication, both texted and spoken communication, also poses the same problem. We should not blame the technology communication but the ways of different people communicate. For example, some people are straightforward and we don??t need to guess what he/she actually means while some people like to speak sarcastically. Therefore, only understanding the person well can we fully interpret that he/she means, but not depending on the level of digital communication."
10,50,20170323,7,"Thank you for sharing. I do agree social interactions have good and bad points. As you have mentioned, ??With the aids of social networking, they begun to encourage more interactions from the Internet and thus attracting more readers.?? One good example is Facebook, which is a platform for users to share their views, read pages and news and comment on the issue. With these platforms, we can learn more about the issue from different perspectives. It allows us to understanding the issue more thoroughly. However, the bad point is that the information from these platforms is not always true since they are only opinions from different users. Therefore, as a user of such platforms, we should carefully select reliable source instead of believing all the information from the website. For example, we can do some research of the pages we visit to determine how reliable they are. Also, do not solely believe the comments of users. Instead, treat them as ??opinions?? from different sectors but not a ??fact??."

As you have mentioned, ??By analysing the keywords, such as ??love"", ??best"", ??great""and ??disappointed"", customers?? emotion towards the product can be measured and turn into facts for further business planning.?? This is the simplest method for sentiment analysis, Keyword processing. It is done by categorizing words as ??positive?? and ??negative??. Then, it determines the overall percentage of positive or negative words in a passage.There??s also another way called Natural Language Processing (NLP). The principle is to make the computer understand natural language input and generate natural language output. In order words, computers can get the meaning of human words, as it understands that several words form a phrase, several phrases form a sentence, and sentences express ideas.Though sentiment analysis is really useful for different business and applications, it is not always reliable. Therefore, as ananalyst, we should choose a suitable method carefully so that the result can be more comprehensive and reliable. As a user, we should choose a vendor that treats sentiment analysis seriously and is capable to update their technology regularly.I have also posted a topic related to sentiment analysis, you may have a look if you are interestedJhttps://ierg3320788.wordpress.com/2017/02/24/the-use-of-sentiment-analysis-in-social-media-analysis/"
10,50,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. Online shopping has become more and more popular nowadays. I am also an online buyer and I totally understand the convenience it brings. Online shopping could be one of the most useful developments from the digital world. We no longer have to go out for shopping. Instead, we can shop whenever and wherever we want, using computers or even smartphones. Moreover, the greatest advantage of online shopping is that it removed the barrier between countries. In the past, it is hard for us to purchase products from different countries unless we go travelling or we pay expensive shipping fee. However, as online shopping is more popular now, shipping is cheaper, some online shops even provide free shipping fee. This gives us more choice when shopping and also have a broader horizon when purchasing products we are interested.However, online shopping also poses some risks. For example, some online shops are not mature enough and may have mistakes when sending your products. Some even do not send you any goods. Therefore, before purchasing from online shopping, we should do some research on the company to reduce the chance of being cheated."
4,50,20170323,7,"Thank you for your sharing. Sentiment analysis has undoubtedly raised its importance these years. Recently, there are more and more companies and websites use sentiment analysis to determine the general feedback from customers and users. As you have mentioned, sentiment analysis is used because it can process tons of text documents within seconds, instead of spending hours to collect all the information. So, how exactly does sentiment analysis work? The simplest way is by keyword processing, in which words are categorized as ??positive?? or ??negative??. Then it determines the overall percentage of positive or negative words in a passage. However, the limitation of this method is that it cannot deal with double negatives or double positives.Another method that can be used is natural language processing (NLP). It works by making the computer understand natural language input and generate natural language output. In order words, computers can get the meaning of human words, as it understands that several words form a phrase, several phrases form a sentence, and sentences express ideas. However, its limitation is that it cannot interpret sarcasm and acronyms. It is true that sentiment analysis cannot be completely acurrate as you have mentioned. For now, it is already a breakthrough. However, I believe it still needs to take a long journey to further develop in the future."
54,50,20170323,7,"Yes, you are right, social network really enhances the exchange of information significantly. As you have mentioned, ??post on social network influences people??s thought.?? which I think is absolutely correct. Nowadays, there are many platforms for us to express our feelings and opinions. For example, the most common platform would be Facebook, where we can read news, comment on others?? posts, share posts etc. All these have facilitated the exchange of information and knowledge. However, we have to be careful that not all the information from the Internet is correct. Therefore, we should carefully choose the source of information. For example, choose some reliable pages and do not completely believe strangers?? comments, as these are only opinions but not facts. This kind of communication can allow us to understand an issue with more perspective and also more thoroughly. Besides, the recommendation feature you have mentioned is also very helpful. You remind me of the recommendation feature in YouTube. In the past, we have to click a new video after we have finished watching one. However, with this feature, YouTube can predict what we may be interested and automatically play it for us. I think this idea is really brilliant. Sometimes, I just cannot choose the next video, but with this, I don??t have to spend time scrolling down the sidebar to choose the next video every time."
3,50,20170322,7,"Thank you for sharing. Body language does mean a lot. When people cannot communicate due to different mother-language, body language is important to show your attitude. When you smile and nod, people will know that you are being nice. Body language gives us the first impression of the person we are talking to.However, as you have mentioned, some gestures are not utilized. Therefore, before going to a country using different language, we should not only learn some basic local language, but also learn a little body language of that country to prevent being rude. My parents have similar experience when they visit the UK. My mum wanted to pay bill after meal, she clicked her finger in the air to call the waiter. However, in UK this action is rude and the waiter was angry and complained she should not do this.Therefore, we can see that body language is important and we should really learn more of it especially when we visit another country to avoid embarrassment."
69,50,20170322,7,"Thank you for your sharing. I do agree that UX design becomes a crucial element when it comes to communication.Last semester, I have taken a course that requires us to make a game using UX design. This is the first time I think the course is interesting because a good design can make the whole project looks more professional and user-friendlier. In reality, a good UX design really helps a lot especially to those not familiar to computers and the digital. Take my parents as an example, my mum is not familiar with smart phones. Among all the functions, she can only use about half of them or even less. However, when smartphone user interface becomes more developed, she started to use it well. I do believe this is strongly related to the better UX design. For example, when she wants to change the keyboard settings, she can easily find it by the help of the icons. This has to give thanks to UX designer who understands the needs of users and create ways to let users to learn easier."
62,50,20170322,7,"Thanks for your sharing. Facebook is now a very popular social media where almost every user will visit it at least once a day. One of the reasons that make Facebook this popular is because it keeps us updated from our friends and a large variety of information from the society. There are many pages in Facebook and it is hard to find one we are really interested in. Therefore, the news feed algorithm is important to keep the users interested about Facebook and the information it provided. It is a good point to mention the five characteristics that may make a fan page easier to appear in the user??s news feed. I believe this algorithm will be useful even in other fields. For example, online shopping may include a recommendation. The algorithm will help develop this ??hope you will like?? list. For example, ??Similarity of the user??s post?? may be useful to predict what a buyer may be interested in."
23,50,20170324,7,"Yes, you are right. As you have mentioned, ??Whenever we search or download something, our actions will be stored as information, as data. These data can be analyzed into some other useful materials.?? This kind of information has allowed us to find out what people really needs. For example, we develop recommendation list and sentiment analysis, these are all related to human information interaction. These statistics have allowed us to understand the need of people and what they want. As an engineering student, this is important because we develop new things base on the need of the society. Therefore, human information interaction is important to us."
43,50,20170324,7,"Thank you for your sharing. You are right that social media such as Facebook and Instagram can allow us to have interactions with our friends and the society. Though the information we attain from these platforms does not completely reflect the status of our friends, it is still a good way for us to know where they are up to. We have limited time to date everyone we know, but social media can allow have a quick view at our friends?? life. Sometimes, it is a way for us to contact friends that we have not chatted for a long time. Though it cannot promote intimate friendship, it can at least keep us in touch."
53,50,20170324,7,"Yes, you are right. Human information interaction is important especially when we study information engineering where we focus on the exchange of information, both machine-to-machine and machine-to-humans. Nowadays, social media becomes more popular than ever. With better development of HII, we can improve our communication, where we can use machines to express our feelings and views more precisely. For example, the use of emoji and the recommendation list in many websites can help improve communication. These are all related to human information interaction. As an engineering student, it is important for us to understand to needs of this generation and develop software and applications than really suits the needs of people."
74,72,20170323,7,"As an information engineering student, I definitely need to design iterative system interface and the related devices. Therefore, it is important for information engineering students to study HII!Apart from the bookshelf system, I want to use amazon as an example. When you type in the key words, it will show the popular items first. Actually, it is just like what the supermarket did, the supermarket will put the products which is promoting or popular in the front and same as average eye-level of human in a market shelf. Therefore, it is really information-centric matter involved HII and information is all around us!"
74,72,20170323,7,"I think everyone has the same experience seeing those ??Recommended videos??, ??Recommended products?? etc. Some of them are useful as it can provide further choices for me and similar types of the products or videos. However, some of it is not appropriate for me. Using the example you have mentioned, you watched videos on youtube, the system will show the ??Recommended videos?? on the home page. However, most of the videos suggested are those popular but the content may not be relevant. For my experience, I watched the YouTuber ??A?? but ??Recommended videos?? showed me about the YouTuber ??B?? ??C?? ??D?? or others. I doubt that whether they have profit when promoting them. So, Recommendation Systems is probably using as a profit gaining tools by selling our information and helping others to promote to us!"
74,72,20170323,7,"Right! Being a software engineer, our responsibility is designing software products for public to use it. Therefore, it is necessary for us to have good UX design especially considering the affordance and satisficing of it, such that users can use it easily. From my opinion, I think there are four elements of designing. (1) value, having the high value can raise the interest of the target users. (2) usability, if it is a website, it should be well constructed, displaying different functions in different pages. (3) adoptablity, it means it can supported by various different. For example, the apps can be downloaded in Android or IOS. (4) desirability, the interface of product should be simple and secrue."
74,72,20170323,7,"The various form of information including physical, semantic and digital is actually representing the same thing. We use different form of information in different cases. For physical information, it is used in the physical world. You can tell the taxi driver about the street location when you do not know the semantic and digital information. Therefore, it can be used to communicate between human to human and more specific. For semantic information, we focus on the relationship between the signifiers and denotations. A hill called ??Lion Rock?? because the shape of the hill is similar with a lion. We use it in a common way. For digital information, it is mostly in human ?C computer interaction because only the computer can read in most of the cases. Moreover, each of the form of information cannot replace each other since they both have an unique function!"
50,72,20170323,7,"Human Information Interaction can be examined by using systems-based approaches. In 2012, Dr. Raya Fidel suggest HII should fulfill the following conditions. First, the HII research used in particular field aims at improving the interaction between human and information. Second, we should study the particular field by using a holistic approach. Therefore, we can have a deep understanding. Lastly, the information systems should have a purpose to helping users. For example, Google scholar search can provide different resources in academic aspect.As a result, just like what you have mentioned, HII can help us to improve system and alleviate the communication problems!"
50,72,20170323,7,"As an university student, I tired all of the learning ways that you have mentioned. I want to share my point of view on the limitation. Limitations of (1) One-to-many: The stand of the author will affect the content of the information provided. If we read it, we should determine whether it is biased opinion or not. (2) Many-to-many: The accuracy of the information may not be correct and the points may not be detailed enough. (3) One-to-one: The time of waiting reply can be very long compared toMany-to-many.For my suggestion, I prefer using the way of one-to-many first. The main reason is we can acquire correct information in a very short time. Moreover, you can compare different scholar resources that found on the Internet!"
50,72,20170324,7,"I second your views. You implied that Sentiment Analysis only have 50-60% accuracy. In fact, Sentiment Analysis cannot be applied in to comparison sentences. When we say ??Apple is better than Samsung??, which is neither positive or negative. Therefore, the complex linguistics structure is a barrier of applying Sentiment Analysis.To tackle the low accuracy problem, I have 2 suggestions on it. First, we should focus on the particular field. The depth of understanding can affect the accuracy of Sentiment Analysis. If the topic is specified enough, Sentiment Analysis can have a precise result. Second, using n-gram but do not use Unigram. With more words inside the n-gram, Sentiment Analysis have a lower chance of misunderstanding."
50,72,20170324,7,"Nowadays, education and digital environment are closely related. It is no doubt that ??digital learning will accelerate the responsiveness of learning and provide a more personalised learning??. However, every coin has two sides. Let me talk about the drawbacks of Machine Learning in Education. (1) The concentration of learner will be lower. We all have an experience of using Mobile learning but we can ask ourselves how much time is really focusing on it. When a notification of Whatsapp pops up, we mostly click it and already distracted by it, (2) Fast learning process without deep understanding. Just like what you have mentioned, we can learn anytime and anywhere in digital environment. Then, we can get our desired answer or solution without out thoughtful thinking. At the end, it becomes feeding method too if learner do not understand what they have abstracted on the Internet."
38,46,20170324,7,"HI, Cici! After reading your post I feel satisfied as I have learnt more about the algorithms of recommendation system. Actually, I have learnt about something called ??Chi-square Goodness-of-fit?? test which checks whether a set of data fulfill a particular distribution. Which filter all the negative results. I think the algorithm you mentioned may be based on the study of statistics. But what I want to raise is: Which factor is more considerable? Accuracy or efficiency? This a big problem because big data is sometime rejecting the algorithms based on study of statistics. I have read a book called ??Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think??, which inspired me to think about the above question. In the new era, we have much powerful computing power to manage data. Many algorithms didn??t work because the computing power could not afford that, but things change when our computer becomes much powerful. The book I have read states that data scientist would rather abandon little accuracy to obtain better efficiency or to run a much complex algorithm. I believe this is the main trend in this era, since I have taken a course about web scale analysis (big data algorithms) and all those algorithms taught emphasized the saving to resource and efficiency. I recommend you to read the book I mentioned. Many books tell the story of Big Data, but most of them only tell a side of it. But this book is almost the best one I??ve read."
41,46,20170324,7,"I think the review you??re made is interesting, as you mentioned the events in Umbrella Movement as examples. I feel that I have enlarged my understanding to the content of lectures, as your examples are clear and easy to comprehend. Your simple examples have reduce my cognitive load, so I can easily turn my cognition to epistemic cognition."
73,46,20170324,7,"Although I disagree with you opinions, I still think that what you have mentioned were quite interesting. I agree that Information can be a kind of energy since I treat it as a kind of Metaphysical ??energy??. In other words, it is not the normally mentioned, physical energy. For instance, we use the word ??energy?? to states the motivations that stimulate us, such motivation is a kind of emotional energy. It won??t comply with the law of conservation of energy. However, we still call it ??energy??, as it motivate us to follow our desires, it provide us passion and the will to live. Hence, information energy is just something similar, a metaphor."
37,46,20170324,7,"Hi LuiYan! Your post seems so interesting, since you mentioned a example which involve yourself. There is no doubt that social media delivery messages and wisdoms. And it actually plays the role of monitor of society very well, since messages can widely-spread in a short period. Hence righteousness get protected in a minimum state: almost everyone can be informed by social media. However, social media can be an evil power if the majority of users don??t have enough wisdom to recognize the right and truth."
71,46,20170325,7,"Hi, Travor! Your post tells something, but you may tell more and add some image to explain what the ??Four Graphs?? are. Actually, I agree that the current stage may not enable us to predict human behavior in a high level of accuracy, but it is perhaps a few steps away. Amazing can analyze your behavior pattern of shopping, then sent you the coupons or inform you the discount of products which Amazing ??thinks?? you are interested. By this recommendation system, it is proved that computer can predict whether one is pregnant or not. There was a case that Amazing ??recognized?? a user was pregnant and sent her some coupons of infant product. However, her parents was angry for that and would like to raise a complaint, but Amazing was proved right when her parents finally knew the truth. It is proved that computer may have better insight then human and make better decision. So do you still think that it is ??impossible?? for computer to predict human behavior at the current stage? Or should we say it is ??almost capable?? to do that? I just want to raise a question to let you think more as I think you may not have a full picture of what you see. Perhaps there are some human properties computer may never gain, but human is not that special actually!"
5,46,20170325,7,"Hi, Edward! I think the examples you mentioned is quite suitable to the lecture, but I am looking for more explanations, such as how ??wisely?? should the policy force be? I feel quite not satisfied, as the details I want to know are not mentioned. And perhaps you should add some other examples to compare with, for instance, you may mention how other nation??s police force would handle the relation between citizens and themselves with social media."
23,46,20170325,7,"Hi, Maggie! After reading your post, I think that recommendation system can much powerful then just input and output. If computer can recommend us products that we are interested, or design that we may not think of, I am sure that it is capable to predict our behavior by analyzing our previous preference. For example, by analyzing the previous data, recommendation system can predict where and when will be criminals. This function is already applied in America, and it works well."
70,46,20170325,7,"Hi, Ken! I think that you can mention more examples and provide more explanations as what you said may not be adequate. How contextual computing works in our daily life? How is the theory applied? We all know that YouTube can recommend videos with our interest, and Facebook will offer advertisement that we are interested, but perhaps we would like know to more detail of the system or concepts."
5,46,20170325,7,"I think the issue you raised is quite interesting, as the public seldom discuss that -- elderly product. As more and more cities facing the elderly problem, elderly product and service would be a great topic in future ten years. There will be an increasing potential in this area. I think social media take important role, as the easiest way to discover elderly customers is social media. Social media can identify a group of targets by linking the elderly together. Since the elderly prefer not to discover new items, we should invite them to come into the active customer group by introducing more and more elderly to them. I believe the same age group can influence the elderly easier, so social media makes the best effort to do that."
70,46,20170325,7,"I think you have raised a great topic: Robotics. But I don??t see any significant theory or explanation of ??how to make robot think, understand the environment, learning and true brain used reactions??. Anyway, I think we should know the process of brain, at least we should how memory works so that we can study how ??human learn??, in order to apply the theory from human to robots. I think the lectures that mentioned the signifier and signified are very useful, as it tells the basis of human learning and understanding process. However, I think the lecture notes are in a bad organization, as it is not convenient to read and understand."
71,46,20170325,7,"I think the concept of VR you mentioned is interesting as you mentioned some examples that impacts me. The physical body in tiny classroom, the experience of being in Atlantic Ocean. These are very valuable concepts, as we may turn it into a big market, there will be big potential if we extent the VR with various kinds of sensors and program. For example, we may want to apply this technology to make a film, so that we can watch a film in our home where we can experience the environment of cinema. This make benefits as we can reduce the place for cinema and enable more customer in a time."
37,46,20170325,7,"Wow! I just love your articles as what you mentioned are full of wisdom, you are somehow the rate one in people as you can understand what the lecture notes really want to tell (although the lecture notes are not organized and difficult to understand), and the level of it. Yes, it is some philosophical stuff that normal human would have no idea what is talking about. I believe there are many preface should be mentioned in the lecture, such as the four main process of memory. These lectures are actually looking at the consciousness of human: how human think in their mind. Actually I have mentioned and explain many details about it in my blog post as well, you may want to have a look what I wrote. (https://roastyourownbean.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/blog-post-3/) Knowledge is totally link with the process of memory, knowing this may implies that we can understand the generation of knowledge and may start to apply on computers."
5,46,20170325,7,"Hi, Edward! I feel interested with the topic you mentioned: Photo and truth. Actually, I think it is a great and serious topic to be discussed. In the article, you mentioned that photo will speak the truth, unless someone is editing it, but it sometime merely show a small part of the fact. For me, I see your article as a metaphor. As we may absorb numerous information in any month, week or even just a day, we may observe the change and trend of the world as well. For instance, by hearing of the news of Alpha Go and looking at the film culture of artificial intelligence, we may observe that computer is somehow smarter than us, some may believe that human will be replaced soon. But for me, this piece of information doesn??t represent the full picture, since what stored in Alpha Go are only target-based machine learning algorithms, there are still no human-like learning algorithms implemented. And that is the reason why we have this course, we are actually approaching the front-most place in the machine learning area, no matter how bad is the organization of the lecture notes, and how hard to understand the concept in it. I think we must observe deeper and think more, don??t rely on the news, as news often report the fact after you miss the chance to get involved. We should have the right recognition of the development of technology, without recognizing the right potential and risk, we may not have the true image of the ??full picture??. How is it benefiting our society? How attractive is it to the market? Is there any risk to the law and ethics? We should have the right answer in our mind."
70,46,20170325,7,"Hey Ken! You perhaps tell the basic truth of computer systems, but I think that graph analysis is something will soon be common, as we create numerous image that include information. Enabling the computer to ??read?? and extract information is a solid trend right now. Perhaps I should say that almost every information has its own pattern, and we can let the computer capture those pattern and analyze them. Photo and image are just some data with complicated pattern."
71,46,20170325,7,"I think the example you raised have shown how complicated are human emotions. I agree with that, especially on the idea of ??contextual algorithm is required to tell the context and thus determine the sentiment of the word??. It is obvious that the positive and negative score algorithm can have no accuracy to measure the emotion of a piece of article, since we are just in an initial step to the semantic analysis. But I believe that all the complex stuffs are based on numerous simple units. As long as we can find out the true basic unit of the complex stuff, we will solve the whole structure of the stuff, and finally make a solid control on it. Until now, data scientists are still discussing how to build a computer system that really ??think?? and ??learn??. As some of them believe that we should implement the learning method of human to the computer systems, so that we have this course to introduce the concepts of contextual analysis. And I believe that everything takes time. When we first approach words and language, we may not even know there are word pun that deliver more than one meaning in a sentence. I believe that computer may understand deeper, if we can implement a right algorithm and feed enough amount of data to it."
37,46,20170325,7,"I think you raised a great question, different people have different mind sets, and so there is no such united way to tell how to compare things and items. Actually, the cosine similarity is nothing about Machine Learning, it is neither about learning via experience nor understanding human concepts. It is just merely an if-then-else algorithm to tell the computer how to analyze human emotions by the emoji. But I think this is just a Nave Algorithm for such analysis, the lecture notes take this as an example since this is easy to understand. If we want computer to know our emotions, it still need better algorithms or even a better system to generate algorithms."
66,61,20170324,7,"I agreed that nowadays social media analysis could be an assist to make marketing decision but we cannot just base on the social media analysis to make decision. For example, some of the page likes from Facebook can be generated by some simple program. Therefore, the result of the social media analysis can be faked or the results is not accurate enough for people to make their business decision. However, I think that although the social media analysis can not be totally trustworthy but its can still be one of the index to show the popularity of specific celebrities or brand. Thank you for your sharing about the social media analytics."
66,61,20170324,7,Thanks for your sharing about the Information Foraging Theory. I also think that nowadays information retrieval efficiency is very important since there are more and more information for us to retrieve during this digital age. I think you could explain more about Jakob Nielsen??s suggestion on two design strategies since I have studied on his suggestion and I think that he had a more detail explanation on this two factors but not just this briefly on how to lower the cost.
67,61,20170324,7,"I also agree that machine learning is one of the best invention to make our lives better. Actually, I am also a big fan on finding new technologies and I always aware about the machine learning development. There are actually some kind of machine learning which are applying in our real lives. For example, the facial recognition of machine is developed in a very well manner and can easy help us to find the photo of certain people easily. I think that after a few years, the AI development will grow in a very fast way and I am looking forward about how it can benefits our lives."
67,61,20170324,7,"I am very agree on how media tear relationship apart nowadays. During my lunar year holidays, I also encounter the situation that everyone just focus on their smart phones or tablets but not chatting with each others during the dinning time. I think the original intense of development of the virtual world is to help us explore the world in a more convenient way. However, we are now too rely on the virtual world but somehow forgetting our actual world especially among the teenagers. Therefore, I think more education on teaching students not to focus too much the virtual world should be done in order to encourage people to care more about people that they know in the real life."
27,61,20170324,7,"I agree that sentiment analysis can be useful in order to analyze the customer needs and comments on some product. However, I think people cannot just depends on the sentiment analysis to make a decision on whether they buying a product or not. Since the rating system or comment system can be faked or created by the product producer to let people think their product is very popular. Therefore, as a customer, I think we should be smart and cannot just trust everything in the sentiment analysis despite that it can be an index for us to moderate our decisions."
27,61,20170324,7,"Actually I am really not a big fan on searching and trusting the social recommendation a lot. Since one of my friends is one of the so-called KOL and her job is to type fake review on Openrice.com. When I knew that her review on a restaurant is base on the restaurant??s provided information but not from her own experience, I was really shocked since I originally think that these reviews from customers was real. After that, I don??t really believe on rating system or comment system of other website at all. However, I agree with you that the social recommendation can be one of the index for us to make our decision but we should be smart and figure out which comments or reviews is trustworthy."
24,61,20170324,7,"I am also a big fan on development of artificial intelligence and I love watching those scientific movie a lot. I always dream of the world is full of AI and it can benefits our lives a lot. Recently, a system of playing chess called AlphaGo is one of the successful development of AI since it beats a lot of well-known chess player in the world. However, I think that human should aware of the AI development since if one day, AI could do most of the works in the world then human will be in a disaster and getting replaced by computers."
24,61,20170324,7,"I think that the content analysis is all around the world nowadays. As you can see in many search engines, there are some top search recommended to the users. Besides, you can always find some popular apps downloaded from the Google Play or Appstore. As a user, I always depends on the recommended trend of the apps to explore some newly developed good apps. Therefore, I think this type of trending recommendation is a good invention to make our lives more convenient and can give a chance for many underdogs to become successful."
24,61,20170324,7,"I agree that the rising of the social media development can affect our decision in our real lives a lot. From my experience, when I saw some people recommended some restaurant on Facebook, I would always find my friends and try that restaurant together. Therefore, social media content affects my decision on the dining restaurant a lot. However, I encounter that the so-called recommended restaurant are not always some good recommendation. Some of them are just faked and the quality is not as expected from what I saw on the social media. Therefore, we should not totally trusting the social media content when making our decisions."
63,61,20170324,7,"Thanks for sharing the context computing technology that newly developed. I have also written a blog post about the context computing technology. We both share the same views on how context computing technology could benefits our lives in a very convenient manner. I am looking forward to have more real life context computing applications since there are not really a lot nowadays. However, I believe that after a few years, context computing will be a trend of technology development since it can really make our lives more easier."
63,61,20170324,7,"I like to explore about the artificial intelligence as well as machine learning a lot. I think that developing the machine learning and artificial intelligence will be a big trend in the following few years. One of the machine learning development, facial recognition, is being more and more mature nowadays. As you can see in Facebook, the auto-tag function on photos is really powerful and can always successfully recognize the right person. It is very impressive and I think after a few years, the digital cognition will be more mature and can help us improve our quality of lives a lot."
65,61,20170324,7,"We always know that sentiment analysis and opinion mining is a very important tool in our lives and can benefits our daily lives a lot. However, thanks for sharing about the difficulties on how sentiment analysis is taken. I was always impressed when I order Siri on my iPhone to perform some tasks such as call somebody or search about some keywords. However, I didn??t know how exactly Siri works until I saw this post. You remind me that the development of new technology was not easily done and it is always a difficult job."
36,61,20170324,7,"As an engineering student, I always dream of developing a world that full of artificial intelligence which can make our lives easier. I agree that if machine learning become mature in years later, human could be replaced by robots in many field of jobs. However, I think that no matter how successful is machine learning, some of the jobs cannot be easily replaced by robots. For example, there are some robots that can provide the customer services nowadays, however, actually this kind of robots are just some fancy products since the robots cannot make their decision based on infinitely varying situation that they might encounter. Therefore, I think human won??t be totally replaced by robots."
74,61,20170324,7,"Thanks for sharing about the Fascinating Recommendation Systems. I think the recommendation system can benefits our lives in a way that helping people make their decision. For example, people always encounter situation that they do not know how to choose from a few decisions. During this time, the recommendation system could be their friends to help them make their final decision. Just like we always use openrice to help us choose which restaurant to dine with. I think people can base on the recommendation system to help them make decisions but they shouldn??t totally trusting this system."
23,61,20170324,7,"I agree that the recommendation system is a great tool to help us make decision in our real lives. However, we should not totally trusting these system since some of the reviews, comments, or rating is faked and cannot be trusted. I think we can use the recommendation system to help us to make some easy decision, for example, choosing which restaurant to dine with."
72,61,20170324,7,"I agree that although context computing is useful in our daily lives, it can harm our daily lives too if we don??t treat it well. As the world being more and more digital, privacy is really something people should aware about. We always heard about some celebrities?? phone was hacked and their private photo was exposed to the world and this events could kill their lives. Therefore, we should aware about the privacy of our own data when using some new technology that are not mature enough."
53,48,20170322,7,"I agree with you that the recommendation system knows our habits and interest. In my opinion, I think the recommendation system will collect our personal information and interest by tracking our activities in the social media website. Therefore, the system can easily provide these kind of advertisement to us. The recommendation system may also cause lots of personal security and privacy problem to the users. Therefore, I think we should think twice next time when we submitting our personal data to the others."
53,48,20170322,7,"I think the content of this blog is quite special and interesting. I haven't think about the concept of sentiment analysis in Cantonese. As we all know, Cantonese have more than 2000 words and there are lots of meaning even in the same word. Also, the expression of the same word may have different meaning to the receiver. Therefore, I think the feasibility of sentiment analysis in Cantonese is quite difficult."
1,48,20170323,7,"I agree that most of the teenager users will easily accept the new digital payment method and the old people will not believe in technology. However, I believed that digital payment will become the new trend of this modern world. For example, there are lots of new online store or platform to let users to buy their needs, such as Amazon, TaoBao etc. Digital payment and e-commerce increase the mobility and facilitate the users to buy product in anytime. Thats all I think why digital payment and e-commerce will become popular in this few years."
70,48,20170323,7,"I recently have watch a video about how an AI interact with a human. Also, I remember there was an AI named AlphaGo have a Go competition with a famous Go player. The result shows that the AI have won the human player. I think Human Robot Interaction is not just helping human and facilitate human in their daily life, but also can produce a new world that robot and human have the same ability or even more powerful than a human. Just like some research said that, some new robots and AI can totally replace a human accountant. Therefore, I think we should be aware of the development of new technology and robots in order to keep our competitiveness."
23,48,20170323,7,"I agree that we can use that data to help us to understand the preference of users. I think as a engineering student, we have should more imagination and innovation. Therefore, human information interaction can help us to know the trend and the most popular things in the social media and the society. We are able to keep ourselves in the front of the trend and able to develop new system which fit the needs of the users. Therefore, I think human information interaction is quite important for an engineering student."
28,48,20170323,7,"In my opinion, i think the format of communication have changed a lot in this few decades. I remember when I was small, I only use SMS and email, which are all in text format, to communicate with other. However, we start using photos and voice messages after smartphone become popular. Nowadays, we may also use videos and gifs to communicate with others. It shows that the communication method have changed significantly. I believe after 5-6 years, the communication method may changed into a new generation, such as using VR or AR."
72,4,20170322,7,"Contextual Computing is actually the big trend for our technology development that computing is done with situational and environmental information about humans. Basing on their preference and information to create some actions people need. I admit that people need Contextual Computing as their technology computing method, with examples like GPS system, Facebook's valuations etc. As the risk you mentioned, privacy is of great concern that contextual computing needs people's information and experience to build up. It relies on stored data about previous user's preferences. For this purpose, people have to sacrifice their privacy."
50,4,20170322,7,"I share with you that you point out the importance of digital environment when related to the education. The use of mobile phones does pose a positive influence on the self-learning process. With the convenience mobile phones and Internet are providing, people can easily be absorbed in their study any time and anywhere. You can make use of google searching engine to look through essays or texts you want, instead of monotonically following teachers' schedules that you have learnt before or you are not able to catch up. However, it still has its drawback when it comes to the use of digital information for learning, as there may potentially have some untrue or inaccurate information on the Internet. Students, thus, should be careful to digest them.Learning with digital information ,undoubtedly, can enhance the efficiency of learning, while this kind cannot actually replace the school education with personality cultivation and communication being some proof of it. These can never be learnt from our electrical gadget."
47,4,20170322,7,".You have perfectly introduced a good example of the wide range of IoTs(internet of things), iBeacon. With the prevalence of the use of iBeacon, people can actually connect to the Internet world anywhere easily to do many favorable things that people want. For example, people can make use of the internet automatically to buy things and make payment for them by just walking around the places installed with iBeacon. This actually can make our lives easier with much time saved. However, I think currently this technique is not that practical for all parts of places as its detecting range is only around 10 m. A considerable number of iBeacons are needed to cover a big area for use, thus costing much money.I hopefully expect the development of iBeacons will be much better and prevail all over the world."
47,4,20170322,7,"I agree that Machine learning can actually be a cornerstone to the promise of extracting value from big data sources instead of relying much on human work. Big data is actually a field where knowledge and information can be extracted and applied to the business. In the process of big data extraction, what it needs is data analytics for which data scientists are now responsible. However, the speed of the data scientists is limited, thus needing machine learning to help."
47,4,20170322,7,"As you mentioned above, An n-gram model can predict the next item in the form of a (n 1)?Corder model. This approximation model is actually so important that it massively lowers the difficulties of learning the language model from data.This model is widely used for a variety of different task like Google and Microsoft's work. They have built up web scale n-gram models that can be used to do a number of tasks like spelling correction, text summarization and work breaking. It can also used for supervised machine learning and etc."
47,4,20170322,7,"Yes, by analyzing the human and social behavior, we, engineers, can actually build up an information system with things favorable to human beings. For example, we are used to developing the recommendation system that is to serve human. It just likes Facebook and Google keep tracking users internet behavior. There is a need to interact ourselves with information (HII) in pursuit of making our lives better with machines. With purpose to improve our human information interaction, there is a must for us to make use of the big data in order to collect almost everyone's prevalence and information. With good human information interaction, we can actually make use of our information to provide more human favourable services."
74,4,20170323,7,"Your opinion in the post does inspire me the necessity of being a designer or even an engineer which is to do our work with great concern to User Experience and also satisficing. As a designer or engineer, we are constructing all the things, be they websites, network systems, software application, hardware, architecture, that need to be encompassed with the concept of satisficing and user experience. Once I open a website, I would expect the website is readable and easy to get the whole content of it in a short period. Once I use a mobile app, I would expect it is simple to use and concise to explain the functionalities. To construct these user-friendly information, we should possess some user experience to support to which version or functions people actually incline, and we also have to make things with balance between the quality and time used for the user. It is too fancy for users to spend too much time on your product with a view to knowing all the details of it. We have to consider making things simpler to digest."
74,4,20170323,7,"There does have a need to the possession of Human Information interaction, on which people in society are relying. We, as engineers, should design all the systems or products in a user-care model that everything is made for users with convenience and simplicity. What we usually should do is to transfer information into some forms for human. For example, we will make use of the big data system for analyzing human??s prevalence like searching engine, most popular searching and so on. We can obviously know HII can pose a huge advantage for human??s future."
72,4,20170323,7,"You have inspired me something I have not paid attention on before, while it is an interesting and rather important topic to me, I, an information engineering, am often keeping in touch with the Internet as well as programming, but seldom do I know the background of programming language. This three types of semantic function of program language remind me that program language is actually a form of human information interaction that allows me to compute things we, human, want into digital things that are readable for computers. Programming, acting as the bridge between human and computer, makes use of the three semantic functions to let us control our computer system easily."
50,4,20170323,7,"You have discussed the topic sentiment analysis and I agree what you have mentioned that the reliability of sentiment analysis is not always high for analyzing. We should never obmit that there are some sentiments or views, which cannot be expressed simply as positive or negative. Many sentiment analysis algorithms are using some simple terms to express them while some complex contexts are so difficult to be translated. Despite this, sentiment analysis does exist its great value of which many applications are making use. For example, by using sentiment analysis, We can,in a fast pace, keep track of public's reviews, survey responses and etc, thus using in business or other aspect analytics."
72,4,20170324,7,"You have clearly explained the content of Information foraging theory that is widely applied in our digital world. For our searching engine like Google, Youtube, Yahoo, they do provide a good information scent that people require only low period of time in the process of searching. Once we type in things we want or ever type in the half of the keyword, information you expect to see will then manifest in front of you right on the searching list. They are ,as I know, making use of user experience (UX) data to construct their searching system. The most popular searched word is saved and arranged at the first stand of the searching list, so that people will probably find the information they are inclined to. Another flawless example about the use of information foraging theory is the recommendation system. It is widely used for the public to find things like restaurants, places, that are of their great preference. Also, people are unnecessary to ask friends or other people to find the places they want to go and, instead, they just need to click on the map or the website on mobile gadget to find it. Undoubtedly, this is the use of Information foraging theory."
33,4,20170323,7,"As you mentioned, Human Information Interaction is actually a cornerstone to the development of Engineer works, as all the work engineers do are designed for humans. The interaction between human and information is so important that it gives the chances for facilitating communication. We are actually using information to communicate with each other, like Facebook, news and so on. It means that we use information to know about things outside and connect to other. Engineers do have their responsibility to construct their product and information that are easily to be read for human with the help of big data and user experience. We can virtually conclude that the more Human information interaction we have, the closer we know each other."
1,49,20170324,7,"The Amazon is a new business model, instead of a new technology.I think your concerns about elderly people can be easily solved by some simplified solution. For example, Amazon can launch some RFID/Beacon device which stored the payment information of elderly people. All the things that elderly people have to do is register once in the supermarket.However, my biggest concern on this new business model is about our privacy. All our purchase record will be collected by the supermarket directly. What will the supermarket do with our record? Our society should setup some new and more consummate laws and policies on governing this issue."
3,49,20170324,7,"I am learning sign language (???Z) recently. In the first lesson, the teacher told us that there is no a world universalized sign language and each countries/region develop their own sign language with their spoken language. Each spoken language is strongly related to the history and culture of that countries/region. That??s why the sign language cannot be universalized.Sign language is also one kind of body language. I think that is the reason of the phenomenon your pointed out."
6,49,20170323,7,"Why language is important to us? I think it is because human is a social animal.We need and we must communicate to others in daily life (You don??t have to if you live alone in an isolated island in the sea). And language (both spoken and body language) is the platform that we communicate to others. That??s why language is so important to us.With the long history of using language, human have built a complete system of language, or you may say art of language. The interesting matter mentioned by you only appeared in some languages that have been used for many many years. Some languages ??created?? recently with special purpose, e.g. Esperanto or computer language will not have ??literature??. Of course, maybe we can wrote a poem with C++ some day haha."
7,49,20170324,7,"What do you think about another similar technology, Virtual Reality(VR)?With the technology of VR, people can reach more information than AR (you can even create some environment which does not exist). In the movie ??Inception??, there are some people that can control dreaming and they dream for their whole life to ??maintain?? their happiness.This is very similar to the VR technology. Let??s imagine, there is a powerful super computer which can simulate a virtual world in the future, and everybody can connect to the computer by very high quality VR machine. We can enjoy all experience in the virtual world. Do we still have the need of city? Do you think that VR can someday eliminate AR or even the reality?"
8,49,20170324,7,"Hi Alex, did you heard of ??deep learning""?It is a kind of machine learning that ??allow machine to learn by itself"". The well-known AI, AlphaGo, was developed by artificial neural network ( a deep learning method). AlphaGo learnt ??what is a good move"" in KGS Go Server by observing topnotch go player??s games.Learning from the environment (abstract information) is human behaviour. But with the deep learning method, machine can also learn from the environment. In my opinion, machine maybe cannot understand our world in lower level or object level (e.g. what is a apple), I believe that machine can understand our abstract or logic world (e.g. how we think) in future.I wrote a blog about this, you may have a look if your are interested. (https://andytangsite.wordpress.com/2017/03/11/bolg4/)"
9,49,20170324,7,"The computer don??t understand that emoji because they don??t have emotion. But can they have?Human have emotion because we ??learnt"" that. What will happen if we teach the computer to learnt itself? Actually, many AI is now trying to ??learnt our world"", siri is a very good example. You can talk to or even ??play"" with siri, and siri is getting smarter and smarter everyday. In Jan 2017, Google put two Google Home AI to speak to each other. The two AI talked about love, god, and ??who am I?? in the conversation.Do you believe someday machine can ??learnt"" our world? hahaI do."
10,49,20170324,7,"Have you ever heard of the ??try this product"" function in Taobao?The online stores send their product to their customers for trail and the customers can enjoy the product without paying for a period of time say maybe one month. With the great evolution of logistics industry these years, I believe someday the traditional in-store environment will be replaced completely by the online store. haha"
12,49,20170325,7,"The effect of social media towards the society is indeed very great. It also leads to quite a number of problems such as cyberbullying, some due to the spread of false information. There was once a case a few years ago that a woman is said to be occupying the priority seat on MTR, refusing to give it to some people in need. Her photo was spread quickly on social media and one user that claimed he knew the woman in person wrongly reviewed some information of another woman that looks alike such as Facebook account and phone number. The related information was spread quickly, which some of the netizens tried to disturb the woman by calling her or insulting her on Facebook, until the owner of that Facebook account said that she was actually staying in Macau. However, the negative effect done to the account owner was already caused. On social media, user information is not verified, everyone can post comments and information anonymously. This create an illusion that no responsibility is needed."
16,49,20170325,7,"I agree that HII is important to everyone no matter their field of study, as communication and information exchange is crucial in our every day life. More convenient ways to exchange information will surely enhance the development of our society."
19,49,20170325,7,"It is really an interesting topic about the different meaning of the same language expressed by something other than words(e.g. emoji) by men and women. I think that the meaning of language and body language is based on the common practice of different people. For example, sometimes when we go to foreign countries, we may not know the language of that country, and we would do some body language to express our thoughts. (We may do a posture of putting something in our mouth from a bowl by our hands to express a meaning of ??eating??.) We would understand one another because eating with such a posture is common practice of most of the places around the world. Applying this to the case of emoji, I think that it may be the case that the practice of expressing anger is different between men and women (men may directly express their anger, while women may put a fake smile to pretend that nothing has happened). Thus, the understanding of the emoji may be different."
24,49,20170325,7,"Many years ago, human setup rule and logic for the artificial intelligence (AI), so that AI can only follow human??s instruction. The reason of AlphaGo is so powerful is because it can ??learnt itself"". Unlike other chess AI, AlphaGo does not use the ??find all possible moves"" method to analyst the game, but learn ??what is a good move"" in the in KGS Go Server by observing topnotch go player??s games.Learning from the environment (abstract information) is human behaviour. But with the deep learning technology, machine can also learn from the environment itself. Isn??t it similar to a human?haha"
36,49,20170325,7,"When we talk about ??Machine learning?? or ??Artificial Intelligence??, many people may afraid that machine or robot may replace human??s competitiveness. Many bosses may fried their employee because they do not need to have that manpower anymore.However, is that really a problem?In the movie ??WALL-E??, human was served by many robots so that human does not need to work anymore. Therefore, all human can ??do what they want??, enjoying their life 24/7. If we think in this way. Machine and robot can make people no need to work anymore. Is it very attractive? haha"
51,49,20170325,7,"I agree that the language ability of people nowadays is weakening, commonly due to the use of simplified words or emoji for convenience. Sometimes we used to forget how to write a Chinese word when we always communicate with others or even submit our homework using electronic devices, which do not require writing but only typing. I think the language ability is something that should not be replaced simply a reason of convenience."
55,49,20170325,7,"I think whether machines will replace human one day is a question that is closely related to whether you think human is acting due to his/her self conscious or purely past experience (i.e. whether human have self conscious). I personally think that every decision of human is based on his/her experience, thus when AI accumulated enough data and experience, it may replace human."
69,49,20170325,7,"I agree that social networks links people of similar interest together, and this may create a great positive effect towards the society, and even enhance development in any sense. However, everything has two sides, the easy linkage due to social networks may also lead to the quick spread of false information."
76,49,20170325,7,"Thank you for bringing us an exhaustive summery of online shop??s benefit. Online shopping is very convenient and efficient. I believe that the online business model will eliminate the traditional business model in a foreseeable future.There are some crucial weaknesses of online store in the pass, (1) customer cannot try or touch the product before they buy it and (2) customer have to wait for a period of time after they ordered the product. But with the great improvement of logistics industry these years, these two problem may be easily solved.Amazon launched the Prime Air project ( https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?node=8037720011) last year, which allow customer to received products they ordered within half an hour by a unmanned flying vehicle (UAV). The Taobao website launched a ??try this product?? recently, which allow customer to try the product before payment. Therefore, I believe that the online shop will replace the traditional store completely in a foreseeable future."
5,12,20170323,7,"I totally agree with you. In Cantonese, we call it as ??30% of the information that we heard is fake, the truth that we seen may not be real ??. We have to analyse the trustworthy of the information; otherwise, it cannot help us to decrease our uncertainly but definitely affect our decision makings."
25,12,20170324,7,"I believe VR is extremely helpful for people with disabilities as they have difficulties to go outside the room. With the help of VR, it can provide an amazing experience for them to taste somethings that they can??t do in reality, like extreme sports or roller coaster. I can??t wait to see the revolution of VR in the future!"
65,12,20170324,7,"It??s cool that you can understand this concept and apply it directly. It is useful to separate people with similar preference and recommend somethings that they may be interested it. It not only save the cost to analyse individual user??s needs and wants, but also it can enhance users?? loyalty towards the company."
68,12,20170324,7,"I think too. It is true that we need to use machine to help us to analyse data as the flow, amount and complexity of data becoming inadequate for human beings to handle nowadays. In this big data era, machine plays an important role to do predication for us and help us to solve problems.Therefore, I strongly believe that machine learning can improve our living."
10,12,20170324,7,"I also think that online marketing will be a trend in Hong Kong. It is comfortable to sit inside our homes and make orders from the Internet. Not only it can save our cost to go to different shops to check which one is the cheapest, but also it provides a platform that consumers can share their personal opinions so as to encourage the interaction between consumers.On the other hand, tradition stores will enhance their quality due to the rise of online marketing. As a result, consumers can definitely be beneficial."
8,12,20170324,7,"That??s true. It is special that human have consciousness, perception, judgement, and memory although the machines can perform similarly nowadays. In this era, machine learning is an important subject since human beings are not enable to deal with such large amount and complex information. In the foreseeable future, machine learning can be ??smart"" enough to perform analysis and predication accurately. I look forward to see how it can improve our live."
6,12,20170324,7,"It funny to see that some topics are very creative. For example the news in the picture, we can see that the perception of the title can be different for different people so that??s why we need to use preposition to tackle this problem. By splitting the content into several parts in order to simplify the sentence, we can have a better understanding on it. Similarity, machine also need to split a long sentence into words so as to ??understand?? the content inside. All in all, language is important but it is also important to represent the content in a clear way."
36,12,20170324,7,"I believe machine learning can make our live easily since it can preform some obnoxious work for us especially washing dishes. By applying machine learning, it can be done in an efficient and effective way. However, it may replace some low academic level workers and force them to become unemployed. So it is true that we should not over-rely on using machine; otherwise, we may lose our skills."
24,12,20170324,7,"I think AI is amazing too. For example, Siri is an AI that assist people in daily live just a secretary in iPhone. It can understand users?? voice and implement corresponding action for users. I can??t wait to see how AI can facilitate us on medical usage since doctors may make mistakes when doing surgery, while AI can perform accurately so that patients can be beneficial."
7,12,20170324,7,"It??s remind me that there is a mobile phone game called ??Pokemon Go?? which can be played in AR. Through the display screen, players can see Pokemon on the street and catch it. For me, it is amazing to play as it combines the reality and virtual. Also, IKEA have a AR function which allow to place furniture in our home as well, it allows users to decide whether the furniture is suitable. I think AR can be applied on education as well since it can enhance the interest of students and provide additional information for the things in reality."
23,12,20170324,7,"Wow! What a good function! If the machine can suggest somethings that we cannot thing of, we can save our time cost to invent new product. It is nice that the new product can match our preference, but I am quite curious to how it works in order to make sure the design is new."
52,12,20170324,7,"Yes, machine learning is awesome. Nowadays we are in the era of information, we need to analyse large amount of information. It is impossible for human to analyse them so we need machine to help us to perform analysis and predication. It is great that you found it is important and apply the knowledge in a practical way. I cannot wait to see the success of you and machine learning in the future."
51,12,20170324,7,"I think photo is important to represent the content but it may not be trustworthy sometimes. Since the picture is just a capture of an instantaneous moment, we cannot know what??s happening before and after. Therefore, the photo can draw readers?? attention only but if we want to present the whole ??picture?? of the event, words or video can be used to illustrate and explain to reader."
64,12,20170324,7,"Yes, machine learning is very useful in this era of information. It is not possible for human to analyse large amount of information so that??s why we need machine to help us. With machine learning, it can analyse and predict things for us in accurately and speedy. In fact, it is extremely useful to identify patterns from a set of input while human tend to overlook or unable to find. Therefore, I cannot wait to see how machine learning can perform in the future."
37,12,20170324,7,"It is true that social media is more updated than traditional one as it can provide instant information for users. For me, the time spend on social media is much longer than traditional one since the variety of content is more and the preference can be set by myself. However, the information in social media is extremely lager and the trustworthy is doubted since we don??t have enough time to analyse them one by one. Therefore, I believe the traditional media still have the ability to stay in the market."
5,37,20170323,7,"As I grow up, I grow up with the internet. I have seen it rises. People used to write letters and make phone call, send sms to communicate with each other. Nowadays people just just the internet to do all those things: email, skype, whatsapp. They all replace the old fashion method as they also create new trend, like emojis. There are still a lot of things we have to study due to the new environment."
5,37,20170323,7,"Yes, IOT and Social Media is around us. But from your blog, i can not see the relationship between them. IOT relates to the small devices that need network connectivity as you said. But social media are more on smart phone or pc computer thing.I agree that elderly has their problem on using electronic device, but I think due to the fact that not every old people are willing to use or learn to use a new thing. The marketing of the elderly is very small, so small that not much company is investing on this field. As I am a engineering students myself, I dont think there is a need to build such thing for them. Maybe one day it will, it just not the time yet."

5,37,20170323,7,"I think Photos is just like words. They can be misuse, they can be taken out of context. Even the things you see are not necessarily true. Just like magic, sometimes truth can be hidden from you. You never know what is truly ??true"". Even the things you know is true. Is it good to know the real true? or sometimes lies is ok to accept?So I think not to truly believe everything you see and hear, judge things by your own opinion."

71,37,20170322,7,"Context matter. I like your example of ??sorry"", human language is very complex thing. In early stage of growth, human use so much time to develop how to communicate with other people. Even with the exact wording, diffenert tone can represent completely different meaning. Just like foul language in cantonese, one word can represent anger, happy or enhance the meaning of that sentence. As I said, context matter. There is a reason why google translate is so bad at their work even it is made from one of the greatest company."
71,37,20170322,7,"Objection! Where is the part mentioning about pornography? Clickbait confirm!But seriously, I think VR are more likely to develop for games and videos only. It is hardly for students in need that they can benefited from it. Just like iPad, when it first come out everybody is saying it will revolutionize the way of teaching, but is it for now? NO! Most of the people owns iPad just for their own enjoyment. VR is great but it will never be a great tool for teaching."
71,37,20170322,7,"That is some bold statement there. I can see the future of computer as you do, but i am sure that human mind is such a complex thing, computer cannot simulate everything.Take ourself as an example, imagine your are living with your girl friend and you go with her exactly where she go and does. Does it mean that you can simulate your girl friend??s action? I am afraid not, since there are so many guys are complaining on their girl friend. What I trying to state is human mind is very complicated, our thought can change in every second. Sure the computer may one day predict us pretty well, but simulation is simulation. They will never 100% predict us correctly."
71,37,20170322,7,"I have heard that Facebook (or other social media) has an echo effect. Their algorithm is coded in such way when you read or like something, it will selectively showing more and more those kind of information. Even it is no the whole story, in user??s eyes, it present in such a way everyone is in the same page as you are.Just like the example you have mention, it will affect politics so much that it will changes undecided voters movement.With that being said, I still can see why the social media has coded their program in this way. It will gather people with the same interest or same perspective, so they are more likely to do something related together to build their social environment larger and larger. For example, their is some hamburger lovers interest group is on Facebook, the ad advertiser is more likely to promote their newest hamburger product to these group of people which is a great business model.I think the way to solve this is trying to pull politics issue from social media algorithm. Politics will affect everyone of us, it isn??t like business, politics is unavoidable. Let business be business, and politics be politics."

It is a type of natural language processing for tracking the mood of the public about a particular product.Opinion mining, which is also called sentiment analysis, involves building a system to collect and categorize opinions about a product. Automated opinion mining often uses machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence (AI), to mine text for sentiment."

Importantly, better understanding of human search behaviour can improve the usability of websites or any other user interface."

3,42,20170325,7,"In my opinion, information is not itself energy. But you can trade entropy of information for entropy of state, which lets you turn ??waste?? energy, such as ambient heat, into useful energy. That??s basically what Maxwell??s Demon does. And vice versa. In order to produce some amount of information, you must increase entropy of state, and that means expending useful energy. So again, the actual energy is not in the information. It??s available in the environment, but because of the entropy, it cannot be directly used to do any work. Information lets you use this energy, so it??s sort of like having energy in information, but not really."

However, machines learn and analyze without any feeling from the database, meanwhile human study and emotion will thwarted."
55,42,20170325,7,"I totally agree with you. Cognition has to do with how a person understands the world and acts in it. It is the set of mental abilities or processes that are part of nearly every human action while we are awake.Cognitive abilities are brain-based skills we need to carry out any task from the simplest to the most complex. They have more to do with the mechanisms of how we learn, remember, problem-solve, and pay attention, rather than with any actual knowledge. For instance, answering the telephone involves perception (hearing the ring tone), decision taking (answering or not), motor skill (lifting the receiver), language skills (talking and understanding language), social skills (interpreting tone of voice and interacting properly with another human being)."

34,57,20170322,7,"Thank you for sharing insight review of amazon go. I would like to share my personal opinion regarding the advantages and potential limitation of amazon go. First of all we can see that, utilizing context information in amazon go can create a lot better shopping user experience. Technologies are invented to help people dissolve their need. However, we have been struggling to learn and manage the complex technologies sometimes, which create the gulf between our ??goal?? and the final ??result??. Contextual computing like amazon go eliminate such gulf by creating a seamless user experience of just walking out with what you want. Moreover, the amazon go shop can be a perfect test field to collect more real time data regarding customers?? behavior while shopping. Besides collecting the final decision (i.e. which customer bought what combination of products), we would be able to collect the route of shopping (from zone A to zone B etc.) as well as how long the user stop or hesitate in front of a product. These first hand data could bring significant potential business value if analyze properly. However, two of the concerns that must be resolved before the generalization of amazon go are the security problem as well as the computational burden for the system. The realization of amazon go need the support of internet of things, which is a powerful field but also brining ??security disasters?? as mentioned by several cyber security experts. Contextual computing requites tighter connection, which means that more personal information (the customer??s face, movement, amazon account etc.) will get exposed in the same environment. Stronger protection and well designed security protocol are needed to let all the entities share their information securely. The last concern is that, all the technology mentioned (computer vision, deep learning etc.) requires relatively high computational power. This may significantly increase the cost of infrastructure for opening a supermarket like amazon go. Above are my personal thoughts about the advantages and limitation of amazon go. Discussion is welcomed at any time : )\"
13,57,20170322,7,"I believe that the breakthroughs in future technology cannot be achieved without the fundamental understanding of humanity ?C the creator, user, and arbiter of technology. And sentiment analysis will be the first step for ??machines?? to try understanding humanity. So I totally agree with what you have analyzed here about the necessity of sentiment analysis. Apart from the improvement in user experience brought by sentiment analysis and opinion mining (such as the online shopping case mentioned), such technologies are first step and fundamental requirements for artificial intelligence to truly ??understand?? human. As the technology is moving forward, I sometimes feel that someday what humans truly need will go beyond faster connection and processing , but rather the technologies that could understand and accompany us when we are lonely. Humans?? thought are ??sealed?? in nature (unlike the aliens in the three body https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032). So we need to express ourselves in semantic information like spoken or written language. Language are the signals that our sealed mind and brain send to the outside world. It is only possible to understand humans?? inner spirit and emotions through these signals represented in words and sentences. That??s also a reason why sentiment analysis is important.Although there is still a long way to go as mentioned by the two comments above, I can still see that we are moving forward. Currently the technologies such as recurrent neural network are performing well on practical NLP problems. I??m really looking forward to the technology that could understand our inner humanity without the necessity to speak to it one day."

By gathering data that is originally distributed in every corner of the city together, alibaba could actually monitor and guide the physical transportation network better and help dissolve the pressure of traffic jam. What alibaba did is indeed one way to lower the traffic congestion. Another possible solution for the traffic problems can be building a car sharing information platform so as to reduce the number of private cars in Hangzhou. Because Hangzhou has the highest density of private car owning, and that is also one significant reason for the bad traffic situation in Hangzhou. The realization of car sharing platform can also be done under the assistance of digital information and cloud computing."
25,57,20170322,7,"I could not agree more with the benefit of VR in finding a house. I'm currently looking for apartments for rent in the U.S. for my graduate study, and I use google street view a lot to check how the neighborhood is like. This is not yet VR but I can already feel the benefit of ""feeling like I'm actually there"" when finding a house. VR has also brought many new possibilities in terms of human-computer interaction. Apart from traditional interaction style such as form fill in or direct manipulation, we could use our gestures, movement, and many more body language (the physical information) to communicate with the machines. VR has linked our physical expression to digital information that is understandable by machines. However, I also agree with the first comment that there exist certain disadvantages for VR technology. For example, people need to be fully equipped with the big ""glasses"" in order to use it, which may limit the time and place that VR could be used."
50,57,20170322,7,"I agree that using social media can add to the convenience of our study process in college. However, as I??ve mentioned in my first blog post (https://ierg3320jinny.wordpress.com/2017/01/26/the-role-of-social-media-in-human-information-interaction/), the influence of social media on human-information interaction may not be one-sided. The faster we can post/access a piece of information, the more rational we should be before processing it. Namely, as the users of social media as well as a student, we should pay extra effort to verify the authenticity and integrity of the online information. Whereas the traditional textbook can always provide more formal and complete version of the knowledge.So in my opinion, we should use social media rationally to support our traditional classroom learning experience. But we need to think thoroughly before totally stepping into the online learning environment."

I would appreciate it if you could post the accessible reference link so that everyone could access the additional information. I've also learned about soft clustering in a big data course. Indeed it is more practical in real life big data problems because features could be complicated and one data point may not totally belong to one cluster. Just like the popularity of K-means algorithm in hard clustering, there is also a famous algorithm for soft clustering: Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM). GMM will calculate the probability that one data point belongs to a certain cluster and can be used to analyze the business case you provided here as well. You could search more about GMM if you are interested. Hope this can help : )"
44,57,20170323,7,"The experiment that day was indeed very interesting. Before listening to the teacher's suggestion, my friend Tina and I measured the length of lines with a ruler so that we know the right answer before the experiment and made the right choice. Although I successfully utilize facts and logics to make my decision, it is still shocking to see how mass majority just follow the suggestion by professor. As you mentioned in this blog post, sharing and commenting the content in social media are very fast and convenient. This phenomenon will on the one hand increase the interaction between human and information in many aspects. On the other hand, rumors may also be easily spread without proper fact checking. The more convenience social media brought to our lives, the more rationality should be added before we make a decision or comment. Rationality here means that we should not just follow what the others said, but we should rather develop our own critical thinking."
78,57,20170323,7,"Your post is very clear and fully illustrated by the figures provided. The example of people's perception of knives and the transmission of news vividly elaborated your ideas. I agree that the occurrence of information technology has made the world more ""connected"". So that people can have access to information in the places that have physical barriers. Information technology plays a significantly important role in the generation, dissemination, and consumption of information. We can express our idea and get other's idea faster than ever before. However, with all these charming conveniences brought by information technology, we still need to get alerted that IT is just the tool to help us achieve our goal and we shop never stop thinking. Take myself as an example, I was using ""grammarly"" which is a chrome extension to help me check my grammar error when composing this comment. On the one hand, it indeed helped me proposed a more grammatically correct comment. On the other hand, I tend to rely too much on it that I won't spend too much effort to remember the true spelling of the word that I typed wrong, which is not helping me to improve my English. I agree that IT can help us recognize the world in a better manner. However, how deep we can establish our understanding still require much effort on self-reflection and critical thinking. And too much of information flooded in every day might sometimes puzzle the mass majority. What do you think about the possible negative impact of information technology then?"
78,57,20170323,7,"This information foraging theory is so interesting!!! I??ve never thought about the analogy of ??animals hunting for food??. The examples of how wolves/fox hunt for their prey are just enlightening for me. And here I would like to talk about my understanding of three steps of information searching. In the first step, you use the expression of ??information scent??, which perfectly articulates how human behave when searching for information like animals hunting in the wild. Take the example of trying to look for a proper course to register in the next semester. When we know nothing about the course, we will naturally come up with several ??information paths?? in our head. Such as going to ask a friend or senior who has taken it, or email the professor about details of the course, or go online and search for the course material from the previous years. We will then estimate how much information and how valuable/accurate the information could be before taking action, for example, having a talk with the friend/senior about the quality of the course. When you find that you cannot communicate with the friend/senior in a satisfying manner, you might end the conversation and try another path like emailing your professor for more accurate information. These are exactly what I will do when gathering information about course registration. In the second step ??information diet??, I can still use the previous example to illustrate your idea. Although we know that the information provided by seniors/friends may not be up-to-date or complete enough, we still tend to talk to friends/seniors first because they are ??closer?? to our lives comparing with professors or course materials in the past. For the last point, I also think that people will move when they find something better. Under this fact, we should provide the best user experience as we can when designing our own products to increase the customer lifetime value. Moreover, search engine optimization method could also be utilized to help publicized our product using the internet. In summary, your blog post has shown us how primitive human nature maintain in the era of information. The insight view of information foraging theory taught me a lot about the interaction of human with information. Thank you."
13,57,20170323,7,"Your blog post has clearly explained to me what is contextual computing and why we need it. I agree with the two steps of contextual computing : collecting information from the context and presenting it to the users.You have analyzed deeper about the necessity or intrinsic reason of contextual computing : the demand to obtain information from the context. I would like to elaborate more here about the necessity of contextual computing. I think the main reason is that we as human beings need the support of environment to stay alive. There is no way that we can survive without food, sunshine and water. In this information era, information has also become one of the basic supply for us to live. That is why contextual information is extremely important to stay alive and live a better life."

However, I think there is a mistake in the blog post. I??m quite confused here. I think that you are calculating the similarities between (5,4) and the other points. And obviously the Euclidean distance between (6,4) and (5,4) should be smaller comparing with that of (1,6) and (5,4). Did I misunderstand your calculation here?Moreover, when the dimension of data points is high (say several million), we usually need to perform dimensionality reduction first before calculating the similarity to resolve the ??curse of similarity?? problem. And principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the famous algorithms for performing dimensionality reduction. You can search more about it if you are interested."
58,57,20170322,7,I believe that this animation will help us understand the process of K-means clustering better.http://shabal.in/visuals/kmeans/1.html Have a look at it!
72,60,20170325,7,"The title is similarity between IFT and OFT,but you have talked a lot about information foraging theory on its definition and application, lacking information about optimal foraging theory.If you want to find the similarity ,some analysis on OFT is also needed.Let me share with you some of my understanding about optimal foraging theory.In my opinion,OFT is a model that helps predict how an animal behaves when searching for food. The animal wants to gain the most benefit (energy) for the lowest cost during foraging, so that it can maximize its fitness. OFT helps predict the best strategy that an animal can use to achieve this goal.I always believe that IFT definitely came from OFT.My focus is on how OFT works.One of the famous model is optimal in starlings.Starlings leave their nests and travel to food patches in search for larval leather jackets to bring back to their young. The starlings must determine the optimal number of prey items to take back in one trip (i.e. the optimal load size). While the starlings forage within a patch, they experience diminishing returns: the starling is only able to hold so many leather jackets in their bill, so the speed with which the parent picks up larvae decreases with the number of larvae that it already has in its bill. Thus, the constraints are the shape of the curve of diminishing returns and the travel time (the time it takes to make a round trip from the nest to a patch and back). In addition, the currency is hypothesized to be net energy gain per unit time.Using this currency and the constraints, the optimal load can be predicted by drawing a line tangent to the curve of diminishing returns, as discussed previously.This process works very similarly to the information searching method used in networking(i.e.internet).which is one evident similarity."
58,60,20170325,7,"15.It is a very useful blog,you explain the e most common clustering algorithm ?CK-Means Clustering in step form which is very clear and methodical. As I conclude form your blog,K-Means Clustering is used to deal with a great deal of data for data classification whose method is to find the relationship between points and the ""leader point"" and then put them into the leader group.Am I correct?"
58,60,20170325,7,"16.You actually did a good job in explaining the origin of sentiment analysis and opinion mining.However,when I try to find out the answer for the title question""How Computer Understand Semantic Information?""I didn't find a direct-related answer??most of the blog explain the definition of sentiment analysis but no how to achieve this in detail,the content digress from the subject.I think the procedure to make a computer understand sentiment information is like below.First ,creating a sentiment analysis model??A sentiment analysis model is used to analyze a text string and classify it with one of the labels that you provide; for example, you could analyze a tweet to determine whether it is positive or negative, or analyze an email to determine whether it is happy, frustrated, or sad.Then collecting data.You must train your sentiment model against examples of the type of data that you are going to see when you use your model. Last , labeling your data.Once you have collected your training samples, you will need to pre-classify each sample with a label. A label is a string that you think best describes that example, for example: ""happy"", ""sad"".With these three procedures,we can make the computer understand the sentiment information."
2,60,20170325,7,"14.I have also studied NLP implementation a lot,so besides your ideas,I have something to share with you about the open problems in NLP . NLP still has to go a long way in the areas of semantics and pragmatics. The issues still unresolved in semantics are finding the meaning of a word or a word sense, determining scopes of quantifiers, finding referents of anaphora, relation of modifiers to nouns and identifying meaning of tenses to temporal objects.Two main problems are inside it:1.First-order logic (FOL) and knowledge representation systems are difficult to represent some issues such as time and modality. FOL also finds it hard to deal with generalized quantifiers and exceptions. Representing and inferring world knowledge, commonsense knowledge in particular, semantics is difficult. 2.There are challenges in pragmatics as well. A simple declarative sentence stating a fact, it is sunny for example, is not only a statement of fact but also serves some communication function. The function may be to inform, to mislead about fact or speaker??s belief about fact, to draw attention, to remind previously mentioned even or object related to fact, etc. So, the pragmatic interpretation seems to be open ended. These are the two difficult barrier that NLP has to pass in the future."
2,60,20170324,7,"13.Through your blog,I understand the difference between social data and traditional data ,in other words what change can ""social"" make to data.As you mentioned in the text ,in the traditional data collections, different people can be treated differently??the idea from different people has different weight, which guarantee the sample has representativeness and consistency. But the social data sample is dynamic, some of the data maybe cannot provide an objective result.So I understand the social as dynamic or uncertain which can increase the diversity of data."
59,60,20170324,7,".Digital Information is a quite extensive concept.You successfully narrow it to a concise definition in your Overview on Digital Information:"" Digital information is originally the information used for computers, not for human beings. For example, the digital coordinate of Shatin Hospital.""This is a clear example but I think that digital information is not only used in computers,it's also very useful in other aspects like geography,we use Latitude and longitude to support the regulation on positions.Besides the definition,your idea about human agency is very helpful for me ,actually we,engineering students are doing this job,when we get enough knowledge ,we can create and interpret digital information without the aid of computers.And I believe that human agency is the most powerful agency ."
17,60,20170324,7,"11.It's vivid to use the two examples,the QQ penguin and the skull icon to explain sentiment analysis,but I think that you misunderstood the exact meaning of sentiment analysis.When we look at the penguin icon and think of tencent QQ immediately,this process is actually information interaction but not sentiment analysis.When you use a sentiment analysis software like Standford coreNLP ,It can not get the meaning of the penguin because there is no emotion inside it without the background information. Sentiment analysis aims to dig out the subjective meaning behind our language. For instance, to find whether someone has positive or negative view on a topic based on the comment he has wrote.That's my shared comment with you."
3,58,20170323,7,"Body language is an interesting aspect that I am interested in. Last semester, I took a course of sign language. As we know, without auditory sense, deaf people interact with the world with their body language. In the class, I learned about Chinese sign lannguage and I realized that sign language is like the normal language which differs from countries. With different cultural background and customs, a word may have vaious kind of ways to express. As mentioned in the blog, a gesture means insulting In some European countries while in China, it means good luck. In my opinion, sign language can not only be used by deaf people, we can take good advantages of body language in our daily life. When we are in somewhere too noisy to communicate with each other such as train station and pop music concert, the body language is a good choice to convey our feelings. However,considering that some gesture may have ambiguity in different culture, we should learn about cultural background in advance to avoid embarrassment."
18,58,20170323,7,"As the writer mentions in the blog, we can recognize that with the development of science and technology, the interaction between human and computer will be more intelligent and humanlike. Nowadays, plenty of technologies appear to make the computer smater. For example, machine learning is aimed at making computer think like human ,big data is used to predict people's behaviours based on data analysis and virtual reality can make people experience virtual scene independent of physical stuff. Those technologies seem so attractive and we can expect a more convenient life in the future."
78,58,20170323,7,"Thanks for you sharing! Your metaphor that people behave like an animal in the wild is interesting. In the process of information foraging, I do agree with your opinion that people are apt to choose those information which are easy to get. In the era of information explosion, people are explosed to an ocean of information.When we make a decision,the most confusing thing is that there are too much information and it will waste a lot of time to filter those junk information to get the useful information. Thus, apart from the technology, there are another significant aspect we should consider, users experience. As we all know, there are plenty of new products being invented everyday and there is no doubt that much products have similar usages. Under this circumstances, how can a product stand out? The secret is users experience. With same features, people are just like an animal in the wild as what is mentioned in the blog. People tend to choose a product which are convenient to use. So, just remember the guideline that don??t make users think. Only when take users eperience in priority,will the software design succeed."
78,58,20170323,7,"In my opinion,the purpose of NLP and computer science is similar that to make compute understand the natural language or programing code. However, NLP is much more complicated than programing. In the structure of programing, we comply with programing rules and the computer can convert programing code into machine code precisely and efficiently. As for natural language, the situation is more difficult to handle with. Not like the programing code which are designed particularly for the computer to understand, natural language are mainly used for people??s communication. Thus the natural language have plenty of ambiguilty and irregular usage. Moreover, a word can have totally different meanings under different circumstances. For instance, in sentence ??he lies down for a rest?? and ??he lied about his age??, the word ??lie?? means occupying a certain position in the first sentence and means telling an untruth in the second sentence. As human, we can understand them depending on our life experience and common sense. However, how can the computer understand as clever as a person?? That??s a question worthy of research."
78,58,20170323,7,"I do agree that information technology change people??s way to recognize their world. Thanks for the appearance of information technology, nowadays we can enjoy a more convenient life than ancient people. However,there are still some insufficient aspects that nowadays technology can??t reach. Firstly, the computer can only provide us with explosion information, but we still should spend a lot of time on finding the useful information in an ocean of information. Secondly, the computer can??t understand human??s feelings and language, so when comes to the huma-computer interaction,the performance of computer is not good. Fortunately, there are many researches aming at handle with those problrms. With the development of machine learning,big data learning, virtual reality and so on, we can hopefully expect that the computer will be more humanlike and our life will be more convenient."
78,58,20170323,7,"I do agree with your worries about the information security and virtual reality. As the development of technology, we are living in an information explosion era. With more and more information being digital and being conveyed online, the privacy are being more and more hard to protect. Our private information may be sold online while we are enjoying the digital age's convenience.Furthermore, with the virtual reality technology more and more mature, we ahould be aware of the boundaries between virtual world and real life."
14,58,20170323,7,"Your experiment is very interesting. In your experiment, we can find that basing on differnet criterion, we can get differnent result. In my perspective, the cosine similarity is about the similarity of two relevant dimensions, even though in two dimensions. Two people have totally different estimations, such as a person hates both two dimensions while the other one likes both them, may get high similarity under the consine similarity criterion. However, the euclidean distance is about your tendency to those dimensions. The lower the distance is, the more similar the two elements are. Under differnent circumstances, different criterion work."
41,58,20170324,7,"Your perspective about the sentiment analysis is so interesting and examples you put up is solid. On one hand, we should admit that there are still long way for us to make the computer understand human??s natural language. As mentioned in your blog, a sentence may have several different meanings, even a person should think for a while to appreciate these meanings and how can a computer to distinguish the differences?? On the other hand, if the day the computer which can think just as a person comes, which means that the machine can take a place of human, what should we do to provent the machine from controling human? With the technology advancing, we should also take these worries into consideration. Being aware that the machine can be intellengient to make people??s life easier but also make sure that the machine have the basic morality not to hurt human."
41,58,20170324,7,"Thanks for your sharing. It is amazing that you have extracted so many data from the twitter and analysed them. However, your mining process only includes the sentence which have the tag #heartstone, most people put up their twitter without the entire name of heartstone, if we want to analyse those twitter relevant to a theme like heartstone, what should we do?"
18,58,20170324,7,"Thanks for your post. Your explaination about the programming and natural language process is so specific that I can understand them easily. As mentioned in your blog, there are many similarities between machine language and natural language. Nowadays, we can use compiler to make the machine understand our instructions. However, as far as the natural language??with much irregular usages and much ambiguities of it, it is hard for us to establish a set of rules to decode the natural language into machine language which can be executed by computer. Although there are still long way for the development of NPL, with more and more intellengent algorithms being put up, we can hopefully expect one day computer can communicate with human like a real person."
69,58,20170324,7,"Thanks for your post. Native Bayes is a simple, efficient and effective method for classification. It is commonly used in the machine learing and big data mining. I also have read some blogs about Native Bayes, and I have to admit that it is really a practical and interesting algorithm. For example, a writer make use of Native Bayes to distinguish whether a SNS ID is a real person or just a virtual account. With three features, number of blogs, number of friends and the headshot, the writer used Native Bayes to determine the truth of a SNS ID. It is really amazing that the algorithm can do such a good job."
69,58,20170324,7,"Yeah, I also remember that lecture when the professor asked us to go outside and take a photo of surrounding scenery. It is really an impressive way for us to understand environments, elements, and information. According to the lecture, I know that as an agent, we are also an element of the photo. Even we don??t appear in the photo, we are still a part of the environment for we have interaction with the other elements in the photo."
69,58,20170324,7,"I do agree that the social network has a siginificant influence towards our life and behaviours. In the past, without the internet, we can only get information from oure surrounding people or limited books. However, nowadays we can almost get any information we want to know through the internet. Through the internet, we can know what is happening in the outside world wihout stepping out our own room. Morever, the communication between people have became convenient, we can interact with others about our opinions through the internet. Not being limited to the real world, we know we are not alone in the world because we can get in touch with those people who have the similar experience with us. Thanks to the social network, we have a more widely spiritual world now!"

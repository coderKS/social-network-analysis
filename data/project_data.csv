Actually, we use many simple body language to express our feeling, like giving a smile face. After reading your post, I find an interesting thing. There is some body language which have multiple expression, and different situation can represent different meaning, like nod. Nod can express our agreement on something which is very easy to use and let others understand your standpoint or express the meaning of good morning. People always can understand the meaning between them in different situation without any confused which shows the power of semantic convention.

I think that the most frequently used body languages is our emotion. For example, we usually smile when we greet someone. We usually scream out loudly when we feel horrified. These body languages are almost understood by everyone in the world. Using these will not lead to some embarrassments.
I agree to you that body languages may different in regions. But I think that since we may live in Hong Kong for a long time, we understand the meaning of body languages in Hong Kong. We will not misuse them. But if we go to a new place, we must learn the culture there including the meaning of body languages. For example, the action of touching the head in Thailand is regarded as impolite and rude. That is what we have to aware.
The most important is that we have to respect, and learn other culture especially when we are going to a new place. Then the embarrassment due to different interpretation of body languages can be avoided.LikeLike",1,id not found

When people cannot communicate due to different mother-language, body language is important to show your attitude. When you smile and nod, people will know that you are being nice. Body language gives us the first impression of the person we are talking to.
However, as you have mentioned, some gestures are not utilized. Therefore, before going to a country using different language, we should not only learn some basic local language, but also learn a little body language of that country to prevent being rude. My parents have similar experience when they visit the UK. My mum wanted to pay bill after meal, she clicked her finger in the air to call the waiter. However, in UK this action is rude and the waiter was angry and complained she should not do this.
Therefore, we can see that body language is important and we should really learn more of it especially when we visit another country to avoid embarrassment.LikeLike",1,id not found

Our tour guide repeatedly warned us about not to do certain hand gestures (e.g. the gesture of number nine in HK means robbing in Japan) to avoid confusion. It is sometimes quite irritating to see people snapping their fingers to servers at restaurants as it is very impolite to do so. Sometimes I would hope that sign language is a compulsory course for everyone so that people would know how rude they are and would stop doing such things to others.LikeLike,1,id not found

I agree you that large group of users information which are related to their behaviors or preference will make huge profit. When a company have such a information, it can give specific advertisement to specific group of people to increase the advertising effect. Thats why some website such as facebook and instagram have huge Market capitalization because they hold billions of peoples information!LikeLike",1,id not found

For me, I think the recommendation system is useful as I love to watch the videos like MV or funny animal videos in the YOUTUBE. Also, sometimes I will purchase the clothes or models through the Taobao company. The recommendation system provides a lot of choices to me and it is saving my time. However, I hope that the recommendation system can be improved. I hope that the recommendation system will not suggest the thing that I watch before. It is a disappointing that I see the same video in the recommendation list appearing again and again without the changing. Also, the recommendation system is the machine recognizable. It only can distinguish the word of description of the product but sometimes when I saw the photo of the product in Taobao which is not matching to my expectation. Finally, I think recommendation system is really good to help the company to make more profit.LikeLike",1,id not found

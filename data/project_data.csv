It applies the ideas from optimal foraging theory to understand how human users search for information. The theory is based on the assumption that, when searching for information, humans use built-in"" foraging mechanisms that evolved to help our animal ancestors find food. Importantly, better understanding of human search behaviour can improve the usability of websites or any other user interface."

I agreed that opinion mining is really useful for the companies to analysis whether the customers satisfy with their products or not. The example that you have given (i.e. Taobao) is one of the significant examples, which can show how a company utilizes the opinion mining to classify the product. I have got another example, that is the Agoda. It is a website which introduces the hotels for the travelers. It collects the reviews from the customers and tries to classify the review into different categories. So as to suggest the best hotel to the users."

It can help marketers evaluate the success of an ad campaign or new product launch, determine which versions of a product or service are popular and identify which demographics like or dislike particular product features. For example, a review on a website might be broadly positive about a digital camera, but be specifically negative about how heavy it is. Being able to identify this kind of information in a systematic way gives the vendor a much clearer picture of public opinion than surveys or focus groups do because the data is created by the customer.

The iBeacon can be attached to something that is worn or carried, or in a wristband or a name tag. In this configuration, the iBeacon is pinging and receiving stations are located in areas where you want to pick up the signal. The user, in this case, does not need to do anything but wear the iBeacon. No phones are needed. No apps needed. The iBeacons, in this case, are passively recording and triggering user actions. Under this feature, retail stores can track shopper in their shop where they are using carts and baskets. The iBecaons can be attached to them and as the shopper walks around the store you can get heat maps information and the path through the store. This information can be used to more effectively drive people to promotions and drive sales of higher value goods. At the same time, retail stores can configure alerts to staff when certain conditions are met. For example, when there are big lines at the checkout, you can automatically notify staff."

I agree that Information can be a kind of energy since I treat it as a kind of Metaphysical energy. In other words, it is not the normally mentioned, physical energy. For instance, we use the word energy to states the motivations that stimulate us, such motivation is a kind of emotional energy. It wont comply with the law of conservation of energy. However, we still call it energy, as it motivate us to follow our desires, it provide us passion and the will to live. Hence, information energy is just something similar, a metaphor."

I am attracted by your topic. In fact, I really buy what you have said, we cannot say information is a kind of energy, but we can say energy can directly and indirectly affect human. The properties in Physics really prove information is not a kind of energy. In addition, I am just thinking why information can affect human so much though it is not a matter or energy. Sometimes the human thoughts are so powerful that we cannot calculate it and it is not even a matter, but it give a great impact on human lives"

Underneath such development lies the progress of human civilization.

Also, you give me a clear example for  Inverse Document Frequency which is also mentioned on lectures. It can help us to analyze the frequency of words in our project.<br/>
Thanks for your sharing."

Using icons with clear meaning can provide more accurate and user-friendly guidelines. there are lots of online resources of using icons. one of the online resources I use frequently is Font Awesome, just including the url as a single line inside the  section while building website."

For the users, knowing their affordance (or their expectations) when building a UI is important since if they do not know how to use the application, they may think that the application is not good. Therefore when we are building a UI, we need to teach the users how to use the software in order to reduce the risk that they do not know how to use the software. I think there will be more and more user friendly UI in the future."

And users are required to rate the movie first, the computer then is able to perform analysis and provide different advertisement as what you have mentioned.<br/>
However, what will happen if the users did not rate any movie at the start? The computer may not able to generate advertisement that user may like. I think that we can make use of  Big Data to perform analysis. For example, an article-sharing website, record and analyse how frequent and the amplitude of scrolling down by users. If the amplitude of scroll-down is within one-page and with time frequent, meaning that the user may be reading the article. On the other hands, if the amplitude of scroll-down is large and the scroll-down did not stop, it may mean that user is not interested in the topic listed. Then the computer should let the user know that the website understand it, and then suggested other topics.<br/>
The above example is just a small case. I believe that making use of Big Data really help to predict what the user like. But I think the difficulty is that how we can notice the data is a Big Data that we can utilize it and making profit on it. How do you think?"

However, after different accidents in the society such as the phone call fraud and companies selling customers personal data for interest, I started to aware that we should have a higher sense to protect ourselves in the Internet. For example, we should not post any thing personal to the Internet, or at least share in a platform that is not public to everyone. "

Headlines warning of online security breaches are just one reminder of the vulnerability of all websites, including social media outlets.<br/>
Despite these justifiable security concerns about the Web, some of the reasons a persons social media account is compromised are self-induced. Six common mistakes that can expose an account include:<br/>
1. Forgetting to Log Out<br/>
2. Clicking on Enticing Ads<br/>
3. Connecting With Strangers<br/>
4. Using Third Party Apps<br/>
5. Exposing Too Much Information<br/>
6. Failing to Utilize Security Settings<br/>
Actually these mistakes we must heard them before, but we always accidentally fall in these mistakes. So we should be more careful to avoiding these mistakes"

This problem comes to a climax when Edward Snowden, a former US agency escape from the US and revealed that the US government had been conducting a world-wide surveillance program. Nearly everyone in the America and even foreign political leaders were spied.<br/>
Honestly, I have lost faith on any means of cyber security already. It is one thing when there are hackers around the world to steal your information or commercial company selling your data away. It is totally a different story when the leading government in the world is doing that also. At this point, I think the only way to keep your personal information secret is never put the highly private information in any electronic gadget that can access the internet."

In my opinion, some Artificial intelligence such as Autonomous car can greatly reduce the number of car accident, but in a pessimistic view, lots of jobs may be replaced by those Artificial intelligence, lots of people may lose their jobs. By the way, variety of machine learning techniques by accessing large amount of data (big data) nowadays brings us solutions for more and more complex problems, just make us more abd more convenient than before."

For example, system can recommend films to a user according to others taste if both of them like a certain film. It is also possible for system to analyze a persons life style according to his/her posts so as to provide useful tips or advertisements for his/her daily life.

The word circle jerk means people with common interests, values will links together, to share their ideas on Social Network. However, for people with different opinions, they may block, prohibited each others to communicate via Social Network. Therefore, people receive many positive feedback from their Social Network, but receive nearly zero negative feedback as they already block the communication channel on Social Network. As they receive many support from Social Network, they think that the people around the world has the same value. Then they are confident in what they belief.<br/>

They chose clothes they love and share it via the social network. It then attracts people who have the same taste and may purchase their products.<br/>
Besides, social network is a great platform to share our interest. For example, some people will post video about singing and dancing on social media.

Information is being transmitted in high speed with huge area.<br/>
Yet social media create distances between human at the same time. There are lots of phubbers recently. Phubbers refers to those who keep looking at their phone in a social setting.

Do you have any idea of how to deal with that problem? Thank you again."

It is a useful algorithm which lets the computers classify and group the similar data automatically. It is the most basic but important step in data analyze. When we build the word dictionary in our group project one, I think this is a useful skill we can take into consideration because we can classify the similar words into a same cluster."

First ,creating a sentiment analysis modelA sentiment analysis model is used to analyze a text string and classify it with one of the labels that you provide; for example, you could analyze a tweet to determine whether it is positive or negative, or analyze an email to determine whether it is happy, frustrated, or sad.Then collecting data.You must train your sentiment model against examples of the type of data that you are going to see when you use your model.

Even for human, if they do not have any information of the environment which generates these icons, they can not distinguish their meanings. Hence, it is much difficult for machines because they make a decision based on a large amount of data. They will not consider the influence of a specific environment. It is really a big challenge.

It is a good point to mention the five characteristics that may make a fan page easier to appear in the users news feed. I believe this algorithm will be useful even in other fields. For example, online shopping may include a recommendation. The algorithm will help develop this hope you will like list. For example, Similarity of the users post may be useful to predict what a buyer may be interested in."

I would appreciate it if you could post the accessible reference link so that everyone could access the additional information.<br/>
Ive also learned about soft clustering in a big data course.  Indeed it is more practical in real life big data problems because features could be complicated and one data point may not totally belong to one cluster.    Just like the popularity of K-means algorithm in hard clustering,  there is also a famous algorithm for soft clustering: Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM).  GMM will calculate the probability that one data point belongs to a certain cluster and can be used to analyze the business case you provided here as well.  You could search more about GMM if you are interested.   Hope this can help : )"

The method you provided here is quite efficient according to your example. You mention that if something miss in the (entity, aspect,sentiment,opinion holder,time) tuple, there will be some problems. I think it is right but it also depend on how you analyse the data. For some restrict condition, one element loss will lead to  deletion.

It is nice to know how Netflix make good use of the user Information and recommend specific video to specific user. You also discuss the problems of Netflixs recommendation system. It may help me when I build a webpage in the future.
http://iecuhkeduhk1155062181.wordpress.com,http://richard3320.wordpress.com,2017-03-20,4,"A really good case studying for our classmates. On the one hand, you introduced the working of Netflix recommendation system clearly to us, which helps us to understand the basic flow of training system. On the other hand, you also raise up some concerns about the underlying error, which is also very reasonable. However, there is one point I want to raise up: Can we continuously use the input data as the training model, so while we are testing the system, we are also training the system? It is just a guess."
http://iecuhkeduhk1155062181.wordpress.com,http://stanleylaublog.wordpress.com,2017-03-21,4,"Glad that you brought up the idea of training and testing in machine learning. In most cases, testing data and training data is required to be strictly separated, which means using the same data for training and testing is prohibited (is like self prove).<br/>
I do agree with the advantages of reusing the data to do training and validate. Maybe when a set of new data coming in, we first use our existed model to do testing. After all the training has been done, we can reuse the testing data for training, so that the data can be reused."
http://iecuhkeduhk1155062181.wordpress.com,http://https237blog.wordpress.com,2017-03-23,4,"Yeah, I agree with you. In my opinion, when we use the machine learning method in model building , the testing dataset and training data set are to be separated. Thats due to the different function of these two dataset.<br/>
 When we are building a model using machine learning, in most cases we are actually designing a kind of algorithm. And the training dataset has multiple usages. Above all, we need some major parameters in our model. These parameters are generated and modified during the training process so as to minimize the error defined. Also, we may need a sample in our model which is to be compared with the testing data. Generally speaking, such sample can be obtained from the training dataset.<br/>
Meanwhile, we are using testing dataset to verify that our model works and find out the flaws which lead us to further modifying our model. It seems plausible to further use the testing dataset as augmented training dataset. However, after that we still need some more data other than this dataset to test our model."
http://iecuhkeduhk1155062181.wordpress.com,http://roastyourownbean.wordpress.com,2017-03-24,4,"HI, Cici! After reading your post, I feel satisfied as I have learnt more about the algorithms of recommendation system. Actually, I have learnt about something called Chi-square Goodness-of-fit test which checks whether a set of data fulfill a particular distribution. Which filter all the negative results. I think the algorithm you mentioned may be based on the study of statistics.<br/>
	But what I want to raise is: Which factor is more considerable? Accuracy or efficiency? This a big problem because big data is sometime rejecting the algorithms based on study of statistics. I have read a book called Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think, which inspired me to think about the above question.<br/>
	In the new era, we have much powerful computing power to manage data. Many algorithms didnt work because the computing power could not afford that, but things change when our computer becomes much powerful. The book I have read states that data scientist would rather abandon little accuracy to obtain better efficiency or to run a much complex algorithm. I believe this is the main trend in this era, since I have taken a course about web scale analysis (big data algorithms) and all those algorithms taught emphasized the saving to resource and efficiency.<br/>
	I recommend you to read the book I mentioned. Many books tell the story of Big Data, but most of them only tell a side of it. But this book is almost the best one Ive read."

Recommending system is really an important part for most of the retail or e-commerce websites as a well built recommender will provide more extra incomes for the platform. Many recommending algorithms have been developed and on of the most popular one is call A-priori algorithm. Taking this case into consideration, for a consumer buying products online or offline, he or she must have a shopping cart and finally generating orders. For each order, he or she should buy one or more products. If we find out among all orders or baskets, the co-occurance of product A and product B is much higher, we may recommend product B when we see someone is going to buy product A. This recommending strategies are much commonly used in offline retailers such as the supermarkets. How to find out the frequent occurrence of pairs or triples is the problem that A-priori algorithm deal with. I would not say the A-priori in detail and you may google it if you are interested in."

However, I doubt whether its true that the existing memory is correlated with perception, is there any proof from the neuro science perspective?"

First let me answer the question at the end.  Can we trust our own memory?  My answer is no. According to your description in the middle part of the post, you say that the scatter elements  in your memory reconstructed the previous scene on Cheung Chau Island. You only recognize those elements at that time. You may lost some other environment elements. For this scene, it is ok because the important elements are all ready, but if you lose some essential environment elements, the memory to you is not true. The memory cannot reflect the reality of that time. So it is possible to guide someones memory to wrong result by using some  psychological methods to let victim to forget some key element. How do you think?"

Lets first divide human memory into two categories: short-term memory and long-term memory. In neurology, there is a Synaptic theory which may be familiar to us. Putting it in short, an event in real world act as stimulus which activates the communication between neurons and results in a spatial distribution of them. As the neurotransmitters are being used up, the neurons forms a certain pattern in a short time period. However, there are successive stimulus. Newly-generated neurotransmitters make it possible for neurons to reform. So it seems to us that some short-term memories are like scattered segments in our brain.<br/>
However, repetitive stimulus of same type(remember the time we were trying to memorize English vocabulary) will possibly make new connections between neurons by specially constructing Synapse and link and form a neuron network. In this way, we form long-term memories. I reckon that such kind of memories are more accurate and intact."

Simulating the machinism of the neural in human brain is also what the computer scientists interested in for dealing with the tasks that originally only for human such as face recognition, natural language process, pattern matching. To simulate neural in a mathematical way, neural network was proposed several decades before by Hinton who is the chief scientist in Google. Recently, with the developing of GPU, it is possible for people to create a deep neural networks with convolution or recurrent to be well trained with proper time. Even if many excellent works have been done on deep learning, it is still a mystery for us to understand what happen and why it works during the training process and the whole neural network is more likely to be a blackbox with input and output after processing, which is just like the memory process mentioned above ."

While the second model is dynamic and more complex. It points out that the lower level layer changer more slowly over time than next, and so on.

We see ourselves standing in a certain place of the space, surrounded by things constructing environment, and trying to understand the place where we are. The understanding behavior is a process of information interaction between environment and us. We receive signals from the environment and process them to form our own knowledge. From this third perspective, which is a kind of God perspective, we realize that we are performing as an agent and we are interacting with the environment by understanding everything in it, even ourselves.

When we hear some novel idea great presentation from professors, we cannot help giving professor a big hand, that is physical mode and perception or cognition, the environment is classroom. Then we use spoken language to discuss with others, or write posts for that concept, that is semantic mode. Of course, present in words also in digital mode.<br/>

http://ierg3320jinny.wordpress.com,http://iecuhkeduhk1155062181.wordpress.com,2017-03-23,4,"Thanks for your sharing about models of information!<br/>
You mentioned that the first model is kind of static; and the second one is more dynamic and flexible. Compared to the first one, the second one illustrates that different layers of information are not mutually exclusive; however, they can evolve together with each other in some situations.<br/>
I totally agree with you. In my opinion, its impossible for us human to get only one layer of information at one time. For example, when we have some perception/ cognation of a depression experience and tell it to our friends, we are in the layer of both perception and spoken language; during the speaking of such depressed experience, we may recall our related depressed feeling, which belongs to our perception/cognation. In this situation, there are dynamic interaction between perception/ cognation and spoken language.<br/>
Hope my understanding would help."
http://ierg3320jinny.wordpress.com,http://fanjunbo.wordpress.com,2017-03-24,4,"A vivid example explains context and examples. For the four elements of entities do interact and affect each other. For example, with the change of agent me on the plane to a little boy on the plane, the understanding might be how beautiful viewing has a positive impact on my mood instead of the how people are trying to change the environment they live. With the change of agents environment from the plane on the sky to midterm exam room, the agents understanding might be how previous hardworking has an impact on my ability of solving problems. Even if all the four elements are the same, it still has a kind of randomness with the mixture from our previous experience."
http://ierg3320jinny.wordpress.com,http://kristawwn.wordpress.com,2017-02-21,1,"Your explanation is good and clear:) About the model of information, I have similar idea with you. First model is static and simple. The overlapping parts are there to evoke how they are seldom mutually exclusive and actually influence one another. While the second model is dynamic and more complex. It points out that the lower level layer changer more slowly over time than next, and so on. Also, as prof mentioned, we can place these two model together to have better understanding how they relate to each other, for example Writing/Graphical language is one sorts of communication and contain semantic information. Also, writing is a way of encoding information, which is a precursor to digital code."

I believe that most of us have had the same feeling when we detach our spirit from the reality and look at ourselves from a third perspective. We see ourselves standing in a certain place of the space, surrounded by things constructing environment, and trying to understand the place where we are. The understanding behavior is a process of information interaction between environment and us. We receive signals from the environment and process them to form our own knowledge. From this third perspective, which is a kind of God perspective, we realize that we are performing as an agent and we are interacting with the environment by understanding everything in it, even ourselves. All of the elements have some kind of relationships in between while the concept of context describes the combination of objects and relationships as a whole."

http://ierg3320hcm.wordpress.com,http://terryhungierg3320.wordpress.com,2017-03-23,4,"Thank you for your sharing. I do agree that two of IT trends for upcoming 10 year are augmented reality and virtual reality. For example, recently, Pokmon Go has become a hot game. One of the reasons is this game is using AR technologies. It combines the view of real environment and virtual item on the users screen. It is very interesting.<br/>
Besides, virtually reality technology has applied in different fields. For example, some learner will use VR to learn a new language. The following YouTube showed the situation. "
http://ierg3320hcm.wordpress.com,http://https237blog.wordpress.com,2017-03-23,4,"Thank you for sharing. What a coincidence that I also choose AR and VR as a topic of one of my blog posts!<br/>
In fact the term AR and VR have been put up for a long time. However, recently they are becoming more and more popular. In my opinion, maybe these are destined to come into being as a result of development in computer science and similar disciplines related to it.<br/>
Nevertheless, now there is a long way to go in such fields. Just like the situation in late 1990s when the concept of smart phone came out. At that time, there was no technology in touch screen, 4G network and so on. It is the rapid breakthrough that makes nowadays what has become almost a necessity in our daily lives.<br/>
So the major challenges confronting us are the advanced related technology. Since you are also quite interested in AR and VR, do you have any idea or plan to contribute to such field in the future? If you like, we may further discuss AR and VR!"
http://ierg3320hcm.wordpress.com,http://alexchungxx.wordpress.com,2017-03-24,4,"For me, I am feeling excited about the development of VR. As the social pressure is extemely high in Hong Kong, I prefer total islated from the real world and step in the virtual world that I looking foward to do what I want and relax or enjoy. There is a famous cartoon called Sword Art Online"" which indicate what can the VR become in the coming future and I always hope that this can be comes true in the time of my life."
http://ierg3320hcm.wordpress.com,http://pokeishere.wordpress.com,2017-03-24,4,"AR and VR are actually an interesting topic. However I concern the problem that the development of AR and VR. Augmented Reality enhances the our feeling with the information updated by reality facts. Although the empathy increases when the supplementary information becomes more comprehensive, People can still easily distinguish AR and actual world.  Pokemon Go would be a good example to show us AR cannot replace the original world. Thats the problem augmented reality facing.<br/>
VR is another idea that solves the problem. When we experience the virtual reality, we just like jumping into a new world that we would be able to sense our sight, hearing and even hypogravic.  But the VR experience would make people feel vertigo or vomit. That would be another problem that development of VR have to improve the discomfort experience."
http://ierg3320hcm.wordpress.com,http://terryhungierg3320.wordpress.com,2017-03-23,4,"Thank you for your sharing. There are a lot of resource in the internet nowadays. How to select a suitable suggestion to the user has become a hot issue. You have mentioned that since some industries may put misleading advertisement through the system, therefore, recommendation system may intrude our life. That is true. In order to increase their profit, they may do that. However, I do think recommendation system is useful for us. First of all, the system can help us to select more suitable topics. As we all know that there are a lot of irrelevant information in the internet. Filter function is need for us. Secondly, we can know recent and hot issue through the internet. When we are surfing the YouTube, it will recommend such kind of videos. Therefore, we can know more about what happens about us."
http://ierg3320hcm.wordpress.com,http://gloriacww.wordpress.com,2017-03-24,4,"Social media is not the only and the first platform suffer from act of fake press media advertisement. I saw quite a few newspaper advertisements which design like news articles. I always read them mistakenly. Even tho I knew it is an advertisement after reading a few lines, but it is still annoying and such a waste of time!!!"
http://ierg3320hcm.wordpress.com,http://alexchungxx.wordpress.com,2017-03-24,4,"The problem that you mentioned are happenning everything. Let me take a example, we all know Openrice, we all use this website to find out which restaurant we are going to. However, some restaurant mentioned that they have to pay for Openrice in order to have a better spot in the recommendation page and even the rating! We must know how to determine the truth and dont overconfident on the feedback system in cyber world."
http://ierg3320hcm.wordpress.com,http://jedtsui.wordpress.com,2017-03-25,4,I think recommends are computed by collecting users surfing history. Users gain some kinds of convenience by receiving some more personally interested information but at the cost of privacy exposed to these websites.
http://ierg3320hcm.wordpress.com,http://terryhungierg3320.wordpress.com,2017-03-23,4,"Thank you for your sharing. I do agree with you that Human-information interaction is everywhere. In addition, I think HII can make our relationship closer. For example, traditionally, we will send a letter to our friends and waiting for reply. Now, we can just open social medias, such as WhatsApp, Snapchat and communicate with others. In addition, because of HII, we have to send information to the internet. Therefore, we have signal analysis and networking protocols to transmit the data and our major is created."

Also, online shops can open 24 hours. Therefore the customers can visit their store no matter what time it is. Better still, online shops can be reached by everyone all over the world, so as to widen the range of customers. I believe that these are also the reasons why online shops become more popular."

To me, the most attractive one is that we dont need to go out to shop. Instead, we can shop whenever and wherever we want. In traditional shopping, we only visit one place. Even in the busiest place such as Mongkok, we can only visit a few shops at a time. However, in the Internet, we can visit unlimited online shops at one time. The convenience it brings is really a<br/>
Breakthrough.<br/>
Another advantage I would like to raise is that online shopping has removed the barrier between countries. In the past, we can hardly purchase goods from foreign countries or it is not popular to do so. However, with online shopping, we can easily visit shops from all over the world and have much more choices. Most of the famous shops can allow a low shipping fee, some even provide free shipping."

When user spotted shoes they want to buy on street, they could simply take a photo of shoe and upload it to the software. Software would recommend similar shoes from online shops. Its easy for customers to get their dream shoes.<br/>
Moreover, theres no more geographical limitation for shopping anymore. Customers could buy products from different countries through online shops.For example, Hong Kong people like buying cosmetic products from Japan. They could only ask friends to help them buy in Japan before, but now they could buy them from Rakuten Market directly."

However, this shopping spree has created a lot of problems afterwards as people just randomly buy things on Nov 11 but then return the goods, over half of the sold items on Singles Day are returned to be exact. Taobao is notorious for its excessive packaging and such act is a waste of resources and manpower.

I agreed that IoT is being the trend of the market and it will be more widely used in the future. Besides the three main area that is using the IoT well, many other industries have planing how to apply IoT on their products. For example, iBeacon will be one them. It can benefit on the stores. This allow people to get the information for the products without the help. For example, you may find a favorite shoe in a shop but you need to know if there is your size in the shop. In this moment, you may ask for the help from the  sales. With the help of iBeacon, you can get the information with your mobile devices immediately. IoT seems to have a colorful future, do you think so?"

IoT really brings a lot of convenience to our daily life and making great impacts to our world by transforming it to a better one. With such great technology, information can easily be transmitted and at the same time reach automatically to human behaviours. I believe in the near future, more applications of IoT will be makes peoples life a lot easier in different aspects, such as education aspect and manufacturing aspects. This technology is having positive impacts on our world and I am looking forward to the transformation."

Nowadays, more and more products are integrated with such technologies to provide better experience to their users. Information exchange between devices is the major factor to make things smart as the program needs to collect user information or activities to provide specific service to the users.

Also, how the companies used such data should be supervised to ensure that they will not sell such sensitive data to make profit."

This is a very convenient way for us to order food or drinks in restaurants as it is not necessary for  us to queue at the restaurants. This can relieve the workload of the staff too because customers may pay the fee by credit card while they are placing an order."

IoT make our life better and more convenient, And there is one popular IoT in HK, it is octopus card. I think in the future we should keep modifying the use of octopus card and make it become an electronic money platform."
http://ierg3320swk.wordpress.com,http://ierg3320lhy.wordpress.com,2017-03-20,4,"Thanks for your sharing. I agreed that IoT is being the trend of the market and it will be more widely used in the future. Besides the three main area that is using the IoT well, many other industries have planing how to apply IoT on their products. For example, iBeacon will be one them. It can benefit on the stores. This allow people to get the information for the products without the help. For example, you may find a favorite shoe in a shop but you need to know if there is your size in the shop. In this moment, you may ask for the help from the  sales. With the help of iBeacon, you can get the information with your mobile devices immediately. IoT seems to have a colorful future, do you think so?"

I understand more about different applications that related to Internet of Thing (IoT) and being used in our daily life. IoT really brings a lot of convenience to our daily life and making great impacts to our world by transforming it to a better one. With such great technology, information can easily be transmitted and at the same time reach automatically to human behaviours. I believe in the near future, more applications of IoT will be makes peoples life a lot easier in different aspects, such as education aspect and manufacturing aspects. This technology is having positive impacts on our world and I am looking forward to the transformation."

Personally, I really like the additional function of Oyster Card. I hope our Octopus Card can learn from them and do the same thing. The data collect is very useful. Not only for transportation, also for property development and urban planning. The data should have public access so that it maximizes the usage."
http://ierg3320swk.wordpress.com,http://ierg3320site.wordpress.com,2017-03-24,4,"Thank you for your sharing about Internet of Things. Nowadays, more and more products are integrated with such technologies to provide better experience to their users. Information exchange between devices is the major factor to make things smart as the program needs to collect user information or activities to provide specific service to the users. This raises a concern of information security as users do not know what kind of data is being collected. Also, how the companies used such data should be supervised to ensure that they will not sell such sensitive data to make profit."

This years project focus is mainly on Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality and my group is currently working on a project which combines AR with Piano. Surely there could be a lot of possibilities for us to explore in the scope of both AR and VR but while we are researching on this topic, we found that the equipment supporting these technologies are extremely expensive. Hopefully in a not too distant future there would be alternatives that are affordable for the public. After all, technology should be advanced yet available for everyone."

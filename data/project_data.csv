By semantic analysis, it can surely reflect the popularity of a product which may allow the companies to take reference on peoples preferences and make further improvements to their products. This can also save a lot of time for the companies knowing about consumers views without asking individually. Peoples reactions and feedbacks are always the fey factors that lead to the success of a product. Hence, semantic analysis is really a useful tool and I believe this will be further development that can help companies to develop more and more good products to benefit the whole society.",53,1

However, I think people cannot just depends on the sentiment analysis to make a decision on whether they buying a product or not. Since the rating system or comment system can be faked or created by the product producer to let people think their product is very popular.

For example, a easy-to-use forum application could encourage users to post more and comment to others.

Regarding your argument, I come up two questions. As your source is from Psychology Today. I would also discuss it from psychological perspective. You mentioned that people would hide their emotions in social media very easily. I strongly agree to this. People do not only hide their emotions but also strategically filter poor information about themselves so that they only show the bright side of themselves. But what I wonder is that people would actually do the same thing during face-to-face communication, so why would it be a disadvantage of social media only? Just think of your daily life. Would you expose your true self to everyone? Of course not. So I think it is a common human behavior, but not necessarily attribute to social media.

 If you ask me whether social media can also build trustful relationship, my answer is probably no. I would say social media can be the first step to build relationship, since we can make many new friends through social media.

With this technology we can know whether the product is success by analysis the data by computer, instead of do costly and time consuming marketing research. But there still is some time for the system to give a wrong justify. For example, if two comment are I like ABC product and I look like ABC product, the system may justify both as positive because of the wordlike, but the meaning of the second sentence is not actually positive or even dont have any attitude to the product. So there is still room for improvement for sentiment analysis.LikeLike",62,56

I would like to add one point here explaining the concept Information seeking. Human being seeks information in a similar way as other animals forage for food. The Information Foraging Theory states that people will modify their strategies or the structure of the environment to maximize their rate of gaining valuable information.
So whats your strategy to maximize the information you receive in this course?LikeLike",63,73

The first on is wearable computing. Google Glass is obviously the most visible example of wearable computing, you can wear it and it can provide you some relative information immediately. Big data and data computation is the second trend. Our daily digital lives are creating petabytes of digital exhaust about where we were, what we did, what we saw, and what we said. This provides a rich source of information about our preferences and our future behaviors. Sensor data is exploding. We have wearable sensors for heart rates, but you can also buy sensors for your house plants or for the air quality in your office.

Lets think about, if you buy a AI robot in the future, would you spend time to train it up or you want it to serve you well without any training? Of course, you want it ready to serve once you buy it. Human being is satisficing, we act based on the most obvious information available and with little concentration possible.

You mentioned the well-defined tag name from HTML Element Reference as you think that may help junior programmer to learner. I partly agree with that as the definition of the tag is clear and can be easily applied. But I have another idea, could we use icon to program? Say we put a book icon at the beginning of program to replace # include dictionary. Would it be even more intuitive and easy to understand? Haha From Chapter 6 of the course, we learnt that graphic information is also semantic and its easier to grasp. Writing programme by using icon/ symbols could be easy and fun.

However, I thing it is not a unsolved  problem. People can know the different meaning by the sound of the word. I think the machine can use the sound to distinguish the different word. LikeLiked by 1 personI like your solid example. It is common to have misunderstanding on sentimental information. As I think that sentimental information is very complicated and can have different interpretation when different people perceive it, computer cannot handle complex sentimental information compared to human. Computer can only handle simple sentimental information like the overall optimist of people on certain event but not the actual emotion of human.LikeLiked by 1 personYour perspective about the sentiment analysis is so interesting and examples you put up is solid. On one hand, we should admit that there are still long way for us to make the computer understand humans natural language. As mentioned in your blog, a sentence may have several different meanings, even a person should think for a while to appreciate these meanings and how can a computer to distinguish the differences On the other hand, if the day the computer which can think just as a person comes, which means that the machine can take a place of human, what should we do to provent the machine from controling human?

http://luiyan95.wordpress.com/,http://mosessmng.wordpress.com,2017-03-16,8,"Hi Luiyan. Thank for your sharing. Upon those days, my Facebook status was all about the news from the Mahjong Society as well. That is because most of my friend liked, or shared the news published by the online media.
There is similar case like the Flip Flops Designed Competition"" held by New Asia Collage. In that case, my friends from HKU also know it and discuss it with me.
I do agree that if the online media or the famous people who share the news will make the news become viral. But I wonder, these kind of news were only exposed and spread out in a group of people (i.e. University related people). The reason why I have this thought is because when I share the above news to a people who are now working. He responded me that he did not know anything at all.
In order to let every Hong Kong people to know a news, I think the most important thing is the content. For example, Election of Hong Kong Chief Executive, which is very important. Then, both the traditional and the online media will report for it.
Regarding to your words that maybe one day people will not using traditional media, I have some reservations. I think that the traditional media will decline days by days but not be eliminated. People will watch TV in future right? Then TV news which is traditional media should be available in future. Thats what I think so far.",66,64

I read the article on your personal Facebook page as well. There is a question pop up from my head  whats the sociality of your Facebook account or the Facebook page of Mahjong society? From the class, Professor Chan mentioned that  social media occupies a wide spectrum between public broadcast and private dyad. For the Facebook page of Mahjong society, it probably leans toward the public broadcast as the target audience is the general public. Online media like 01 can gather information from it; but for your personal Facebook page, I think it leans toward the private dyad as only your friends can view your posts.",66,73
http://luiyan95.wordpress.com/,http://ierg3320101.wordpress.com,2017-03-24,9,"Hi Luiyan, thank you for your sharing. I came across the news that you mentioned in your sharing earlier days as some of my friends commented on it, or shared it. In your case, I can see the rise of social media and why. In fact, I think spreading posts or articles on social media is quite similar as spreading the news through traditional media. Nowadays, we spread information by sharing it with our friends on social media. In the past, we spread information by telling friends directly. It all depends on sharing to our friends. Only that with the assistant of the advanced technology, information can be spread more swiftly and efficiently to a large group of people on social media, which users spend more time on than traditional media as you mentioned.
The rise of social media provides a new way of promotion and arousing public concerns towards certain issues. However, I think it is hard for social media to take over traditional media completely at all in coming years. Perhaps for a certain kind of traditional media, for example, newspapers, it can be transformed into social media. However, for television, another kind of traditional media, it should still have its own market value with the different programs.",66,54

For me, the time spend on social media is much longer than traditional one since the variety of content is more and the preference can be set by myself. However, the information in social media is extremely lager and the trustworthy is doubted since we dont have enough time to analyse them one by one. Therefore, I believe the traditional  media still have the ability to stay in the market.",66,70

Computer sees things differently from human being as digital cognition is completely opposite to human cognition. Human agents start from embodiment to abstraction whilst digital agents start from abstraction to embodiment. Computer tends to apply mathematics like vector space model and cosine similarity to differentiate 2 objects. Honestly, its a clever way to do so, but I think the key challenge is that how to set up the parameters. In the smiling face case, the parameters are the curvature of month and eyes. But what if I want to write an algo to differentiate human being and animals? The parameters could be the number of legs, hands and the size of body.

I am also excited in doing the project as well:)Actually, machine learning could be applied in many different areas, not only in semantic analysis. According to https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-possible-applications-of-machine-learning, machine learning could be applied in
1. Face detection
2. Face recognition
3. Image classification
4. Speech recognition
5. Google
6. Anti-virus
7. Anti-spam
8. Genetics
9. Signal denoising
10. Weather forecastFor the number 7, Anti-spam, I have experienced in writing to spam filtering project in the course machine learning. We were given a set of training data including the normal email and the spam email. A set of testing data mixing the normal and spam email is also given. We need to train our own model to filter out the spam in the testing data. We applied some popular machine learning algorithm such as svm regression, random forest, logistic regression and naive Bayes classifier. Finally, we found that the result of random forest is the most accurate!I believe that machine learning could also be applied in much more area. So I am looking forward to seeing the future usage of it.LikeLike",69,46

Also more important than quick checkout: selection, high-quality products, and good weekly sales and promotions. Whats more, Amazons advantage in checkout times is already narrowing. Traditional grocery stores have made progress at reducing times considerably  Kroger lowered its average checkout wait time to 30 seconds from 3-4 minutes historically, according to Morgan Stanley. And Wal-Marts mobile app now allows for quick scan and go purchases at Sams Club.

But after reading your blog post, I know that the computer will list out all of the probability that the Chinese sentence means. And then after running a scoring function, the computer determine the meaning of the sentences by the scoring function (probability).
But I wonder, in such case, although the computer knows that one Chinese sentences can have different meanings, it will only determine it as one meaning. How about the others meaning which are still possible too? Is that the computer will analyse the whole paragraph in the scoring function?
Moreover, there are sometimes pun, also called paronomasia, is a form of word play that exploits multiple meanings of a term, or of similar-sounding words. But in the case above, computer only explain it in one meaning. I think this is the limitation of the scoring function so far. Will there be a scoring function for pun?

Therefore, in order to collect personal information such as GPS location more easily, the users must agree the applications to collect before launching it. Moreover, to give more confident to the users, I think that the ways of handling such privacy information should be listed in terms and condition. I think that success example like Map Application, users are required to give their locations in order to have navigation options.
I think the most important factor for the users to give personal information in exchange for a context is the attractiveness of the context.

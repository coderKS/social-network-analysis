It can help marketers evaluate the success of an ad campaign or new product launch, determine which versions of a product or service are popular and identify which demographics like or dislike particular product features. For example, a review on a website might be broadly positive about a digital camera, but be specifically negative about how heavy it is. Being able to identify this kind of information in a systematic way gives the vendor a much clearer picture of public opinion than surveys or focus groups do because the data is created by the customer.  However, there are also several challenges in opinion mining. The first is that a word that is considered to be positive in one situation may be considered negative in another situation. Take the word long"" for instance. If a customer said a laptops battery life was long, that would be a positive opinion.  If the customer said that the laptops start-up time was long, however, that would be is a negative opinion. These differences mean that an opinion system trained to gather opinions on one type of product or product feature may not perform very well on another. A second challenge is that people dont always express opinions the same way.

And sentiment analysis will be the first step for machines to try understanding humanity.  So I totally agree with what you have analyzed here about the necessity of sentiment analysis.
Apart from the improvement in user experience brought by sentiment analysis and opinion mining (such as the online shopping case mentioned), such technologies are first step and fundamental requirements for artificial intelligence to truly understand human. As the technology is moving forward, I sometimes feel  that someday what humans truly need will go beyond faster connection and processing , but rather the technologies that could understand and accompany us when we are lonely.  Humans thought are sealed in nature (unlike the aliens in the three body https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032). So we need to express ourselves in semantic information like spoken or written language.   Language are the signals that our sealed mind and brain send to the outside world.  It is only possible to understand humans inner spirit and emotions through these signals represented in words and sentences. Thats also a reason why sentiment analysis is important.
Although there is still a long way to go as mentioned by the two comments above, I can still see that we are moving forward.  Currently the technologies such as recurrent neural network are performing well on practical NLP problems.  Im really looking forward to the technology that could understand our inner humanity without the necessity to speak to it one day.LikeLiked by 1 person",3,14

http://ierg3320tina.wordpress.com,http://fanjunbo.wordpress.com,2017-03-24,9,"I think the sentiment analysis doesnt need a deep understanding of humanity. In the past, for natural language processing problems, the scientists used to try to understand how human use languages. They asked for help from the linguists to build a complex grammar rules to teach computers as they thought language is created by human so it is necessary to understand how people learn and use language firstly. But limited progress was done. For example, computer might know each single word but they dont understand the relation or sentiment of words. For sentences, they are meaningful as they are related with each other and the environment. I like it is general and meaningless but if I say How nice the car is before, I like it is meaningful and showing my favour to that car with the intention Im going to buy it. Nowadays, most of NLP breakthroughs come from the application of neural network and deep learning. Ten years age, Yoshua Bengio use neural network to get word vector. Words are presented into a fixed length vector with semantic and syntax. For example, vector(man)  vector(women) = vector(king)  vector(queen), vector(is)  vector(was) = vector(are)  vector(were), without tagging each words like dictionary. The strategy is to train the network with billions of sentences and let the computer learn a kind of language by itself without taking the human grammar or languages rules or understandings into consideration.LikeLike",3,23

But both of them requires devices to have constant availability and are completely connected.

One enlightening view given by the author is that, the occurrence of new forms of information is NOT the replacement for the older form, but rather an enlargement for them.  Languages can help us describe physical information better and break the walls of physical information to spread the information in a wider range.

Also in computer science we learned about data structure, which is a topic related to abstraction. Similarly,  when it comes to information, we find that physical information is the most concrete but in the meantime most restricted to a certain time period and geographical  region. For the semantic information, the transfer from physical objects to symbols makes it easily recognizable by a wider range of people. It is very similar to a interface between human and physical information. Then came digital information.

This article reveals what semantic information, physical information and digital information are. Nowadys, the technology is fast growing. A plenty of innovative product would make use of these three information. I agree with the article do much that semantic information is not limited by space and time, we always keep in touch with this information. To be honest, PC and mobile help human dealing with a great deal of problems. Solutions are always shown as the semantic information existing in online and abstract space. If we need to know how human get message and how human think, this article definitely helps on this aspect.LikeLike",3,77

I do agree with your idea that the flourish of digital information helps people obtain semantic and physical information much easier. Nowadays, we can easily gain any information we want through Internet  a network makes main contribution to the fast spread of digital information. However, there are some problems we should take into consideration which brought by the Internet. First of all, it is a fact that we can get any type of information much easier. But from another perspective, it means that we wont spend such a long time to prove the correctness of the information we obtain. Furthermore, fast spread of information also lets our private information become much easier to be leaked. Security problem is really important in information era.LikeLike",3,33

However, what will happen if the users did not rate any movie at the start? The computer may not able to generate advertisement that user may like.

However, for people with different opinions, they may block, prohibited each others to communicate via Social Network. Therefore, people receive many positive feedback from their Social Network, but receive nearly zero negative feedback as they already block the communication channel on Social Network. As they receive many support from Social Network, they think that the people around the world has the same value. Then they are confident in what they belief.
However, the real world does not follow the same. The real world exist people with different opinions.

And today, technological development in communications and travel has grown rapidly, friendship networks have expanded and spanned greater distances. The social media connects each other closer and thus the modern world becomes shrinking as what Karinthy believed. Due to the ever-increasing connectedness of human beings, the physical distances impose smaller influence on connections between the globes individuals while the growing density of human networks makes the actual social distance far smaller.

They chose clothes they love and share it via the social network. It then attracts people who have the same taste and may purchase their products.
Besides, social network is a great platform to share our interest. For example, some people will post video about singing and dancing on social media.

Without a good UX, like inconvenience or fussy design, it is difficult to attract customers to use the product in a long run. Even though we dont use this one, we still have a wide range of other alternatives to choose. In regards to a product with excellent UX, iMac or iPhone are just what I have in mind.

The reason why users choose the  path but not the road (your first picture) is that the designers did not consider from the perspective of customers when they do their designing.

As long as the product can bring convenience to us, we would like to make use of it and ease our life. No one want to use a product that actually makes our life harder! If online shopping needs complex procedures rather than Buy now with 1-click, everyone will go to grocery or shopping mall directly.

Im now taking courses in Human-Computer Interaction (SEEM3510) and learnt several useful techniques in designing interface with high usability.

And here I would like to comment about how we could measure or evaluate one design. There are five human factors that could help us quantify the quality of a design:
1)	Easy to learn
A good UI should give clear and consistent instruction so that the users can learn to use it very quickly.  In the amazon case given by you, the buttons are arranged in a clear manner so the user know how to perform an action like buying a product at the first glance.
2)	Easy to memorize
A good product doesnt have a lot of command for the user to remember. For example in iOS or MAC OS, most of the operations can be done by fingers. And the gestures such as squeezing with two fingers usually carry semantic meanings that could help the user to memorize its function.
3)	Low error rate
A good design will prevent the occurrence of error. For example,  http://www.airbnb.com  will gray out the unavailable date in the calendar when the users are selecting their check-in and check-out time.
4)	Subjective Satisfaction
A good design should gain enough subjective satisfaction from the user.
5)	Easy to use
A good product should have high efficiency in performing the targeted task. The best interface is no interface. The users can get fully control of what is going on and there should be no gulf of execution.LikeLiked by 1 person",9,14

Last semester, I have taken a course that requires us to make a game using UX design. This is the first time I think the course is interesting because a good design can make the whole project looks more professional and user-friendlier. In reality, a good UX design really helps a lot especially to those not familiar to computers and the digital. Take my parents as an example, my mum is not familiar with smart phones. Among all the functions, she can only use about half of them or even less. However, when smartphone user interface becomes more developed, she started to use it well. I do believe this is strongly related to the better UX design. For example, when she wants to change the keyboard settings, she can easily find it by the help of the icons. This has to give thanks to UX designer who understands the needs of users and create ways to let users to learn easier.LikeLiked by 1 person",9,35

This design might not work that well for Asians, especially for people who are not that familiar with smartphones, as we tend to trust things we can see rather than online payment, and the button could easily be pressed accidentally.

It contains many functions which are similar to smart phone. Although the functions between Apple Watch and phone are quite similar, Apple Watch still has its own market. The reason behind may be because of the simplicity. For example, Apple Watch can simply read and reply email instead of pulling the phone. Also, calendar notifications become easily notice.

Therefore, as you mentioned before, simple may be good enough. If they can navigate the applications easily and find out that the application is easy to use it, people will use it again after experiencing the application. For a designer like we should think about it seriously. Apart from the simple of the application, the first impression design should be another point in UX that we should concern. People decide whether an application is worth their time just in short period of time. So we should design it beautifully.

Sometimes it is more effective than analyzing ones words. A common example is that ones feet is pointing to the door.

I also agree with you that we should be careful about our body language. One of the examples is that expressing a number three with your fingers. If you hold your thumb and pinky together first and then stick the other three fingers with your thumb and pinky, it is a kind of impoliteness in some countries.

To some degree, I believe that our computers will become something similar to ourselves humankind.

First ,creating a sentiment analysis modelA sentiment analysis model is used to analyze a text string and classify it with one of the labels that you provide; for example, you could analyze a tweet to determine whether it is positive or negative, or analyze an email to determine whether it is happy, frustrated, or sad.Then collecting data.You must train your sentiment model against examples of the type of data that you are going to see when you use your model. Last , labeling your data.Once you have collected your training samples, you will need to pre-classify each sample with a label. A label is a string that you think best describes that example, for example: happy, sad.With these three procedures,we can make the computer understand the sentiment information.",11,34

And as a point of my view, there are sevral difficulties we need to deal with in sentiment analysis and opinion mining. For instance, in your picture, the icon is chair obviously. But there are a lot of icons which have multiple meanings in different situations. Even for human, if they do not have any information of the environment which generates these icons, they can not distinguish their meanings. Hence, it is much difficult for machines because they make a decision based on a large amount of data. They will not consider the influence of a specific environment. It is really a big challenge. If we can solve it which means our machine can perform like a human, it will be a great milestone of human development.",11,33

One of the advantages of recommendation system is that it can learn from users historical searching records and summarise some latent behaving patterns. However, since the system relies on learning input data, it can only perform well in limited areas based on the given knowledge. For the unknown area, it is hard for the system to guess or make any recommendation. For example, my YouTube homepage only lists videos belonging to several types that I watch frequently. I am glad that the system allows me to keep following the latest videos of my favourite online shows but it is also true that I have less chance to get in touch with other types of video.

In the first cycle, Firstly, they need to generate hypotheses of the users preference via a matrix; secondly, they train the model withusers historical data and correct worry values in the matrix; lastly, they update matrixs values and evaluate the model. In the second circle, they first use the new algorithm to generate recommendations for users; if the this recommendation succeeds, they use this algorithm for recommendation; however, if the recommendation fails, they need to go back to the first circle and make a new algorithm.

Lets first divide human memory into two categories: short-term memory and long-term memory. In neurology, there is a Synaptic theory which may be familiar to us. Putting it in short, an event in real world act as stimulus which activates the communication between neurons and results in a spatial distribution of them. As the neurotransmitters are being used up, the neurons forms a certain pattern in a short time period. However, there are successive stimulus. Newly-generated neurotransmitters make it possible for neurons to reform. So it seems to us that some short-term memories are like scattered segments in our brain.
However, repetitive stimulus of same type(remember the time we were trying to memorize English vocabulary) will possibly make new connections between neurons by specially constructing Synapse and link and form a neuron network. In this way, we form long-term memories. I reckon that such kind of memories are more accurate and intact.",13,id not found

On the one hand, you introduced the working of Netflix recommendation system clearly to us, which helps us to understand the basic flow of training system. On the other hand, you also raise up some concerns about the underlying error, which is also very reasonable. However, there is one point I want to raise up: Can we continuously use the input data as the training model, so while we are testing the system, we are also training the system? It is just a guess.Glad that you brought up the idea of training and testing in machine learning. In most cases, testing data and training data is required to be strictly separated, which means using the same data for training and testing is prohibited (is like self prove).
I do agree with the advantages of reusing the data to do training and validate. Maybe when a set of new data coming in, we first use our existed model to do testing. After all the training has been done, we can reuse the testing data for training, so that the data can be reused.Yeah, I agree with you. In my opinion, when we use the machine learning method in model building , the testing dataset and training data set are to be separated. Thats due to the different function of these two dataset.
 When we are building a model using machine learning, in most cases we are actually designing a kind of algorithm. And the training dataset has multiple usages. Above all, we need some major parameters in our model. These parameters are generated and modified during the training process so as to minimize the error defined. Also, we may need a sample in our model which is to be compared with the testing data. Generally speaking, such sample can be obtained from the training dataset.
Meanwhile, we are using testing dataset to verify that our model works and find out the flaws which lead us to further modifying our model. It seems plausible to further use the testing dataset as augmented training dataset. However, after that we still need some more data other than this dataset to test our model.",13,42

After reading your post, I feel satisfied as I have learnt more about the algorithms of recommendation system. Actually, I have learnt about something called Chi-square Goodness-of-fit test which checks whether a set of data fulfill a particular distribution. Which filter all the negative results. I think the algorithm you mentioned may be based on the study of statistics.
	But what I want to raise is: Which factor is more considerable? Accuracy or efficiency? This a big problem because big data is sometime rejecting the algorithms based on study of statistics. I have read a book called Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think, which inspired me to think about the above question.
	In the new era, we have much powerful computing power to manage data. Many algorithms didnt work because the computing power could not afford that, but things change when our computer becomes much powerful. The book I have read states that data scientist would rather abandon little accuracy to obtain better efficiency or to run a much complex algorithm. I believe this is the main trend in this era, since I have taken a course about web scale analysis (big data algorithms) and all those algorithms taught emphasized the saving to resource and efficiency.
	I recommend you to read the book I mentioned. Many books tell the story of Big Data, but most of them only tell a side of it. But this book is almost the best one Ive read.",13,id not found

Recommending system is really an important part for most of the retail or e-commerce websites as a well built recommender will provide more extra incomes for the platform. Many recommending algorithms have been developed and on of the most popular one is call A-priori algorithm. Taking this case into consideration, for a consumer buying products online or offline, he or she must have a shopping cart and finally generating orders. For each order, he or she should buy one or more products. If we find out among all orders or baskets, the co-occurance of product A and product B is much higher, we may recommend product B when we see someone is going to buy product A. This recommending strategies are much commonly used in offline retailers such as the supermarkets. How to find out the frequent occurrence of pairs or triples is the problem that A-priori algorithm deal with. I would not say the A-priori in detail and you may google it if you are interested in.",13,23

Product design does not only represent the appearance or the layout, but also play the role of a guide that leads our end users to follow the procedures and fulfil their purposes. For example, when we are shopping online, we would like to check categories listed on one webpage. If the catalogue includes too many branches, it will be too specific for customers to choose a proper tag. In contrast, if it is too general, referring to everything actually refers to nothing. To create a useful guide, we need to study target users and adapt our strategy toward corresponding behaviours/habits.LikeLiked by 1 person",14,id not found

If I try to justify those points in popular UI design cases, I can find out that those successes all follow the principals and take them as their baseline. However, I think the hardest part in UI design is to keep balance between those points. i.e. if an app UI design team wants to increase their universal usability in  other platforms like Android or Windows, the most straight forward way to do it is to transplant their app and make them suitable for the local requirements. In the same time, they may suffer from problems which arises from being universal, like lower stability and performance, increase of size etc.LikeLiked by 1 person",14,44

In the past time, we use paper or books to interact with information and the quality of the information is much higher because printing books seems to be a hard and expansive job.

I totally agree with you that semantic information plays an really essential part of civilisation.
Associating with the three layers of information- physical, semantic, and digital, physical information and semantic information often have tightly interaction with each other. For example, we see some physical objects; and we transfer this physical information into semantic information (i.e. language). Actually, different culture/origins has really different understanding/ perception towards the same physical object. For instance, colour red is more of festiveness for Chinese, but its more of bloodiness/ violence for English. From this perspective, if we want to transfer the same physical information into different languages, the perception/ cognation we use may be different, which means that people having different dominant languages may have different perception/ cognation.
From this point of view, the same semantic information plays different roles in different civilisation.LikeLike",14,13

The understanding behavior is a process of information interaction between environment and us. We receive signals from the environment and process them to form our own knowledge. From this third perspective, which is a kind of God perspective, we realize that we are performing as an agent and we are interacting with the environment by understanding everything in it, even ourselves.

I totally agree with you. In my opinion, its impossible for us human to get only one layer of information at one time. For example, when we have some perception/ cognation of a depression experience and tell it to our friends, we are in the layer of both perception and spoken language; during the speaking of such depressed experience, we may recall our related depressed feeling, which belongs to our perception/cognation.

The wide application of recommendation systems makes online shopping more convenient and easier. It also provides a new way for us to get in touch with the numerous information. For example, when you watched a video about cooking on YouTube, many other cooking videos are recommended. It is not necessary for us to search for another cooking video again. Various information is provided in a short time.

Nevertheless, now there is a long way to go in such fields. Just like the situation in late 1990s when the concept of smart phone came out. At that time, there was no technology in touch screen, 4G network and so on. It is the rapid breakthrough that makes nowadays what has become almost a necessity in our daily lives.

Although the empathy increases when the supplementary information becomes more comprehensive, People can still easily distinguish AR and actual world.  Pokemon Go would be a good example to show us AR cannot replace the original world. Thats the problem augmented reality facing.
VR is another idea that solves the problem. When we experience the virtual reality, we just like jumping into a new world that we would be able to sense our sight, hearing and even hypogravic.

Even in the busiest place such as Mongkok, we can only visit a few shops at a time. However, in the Internet, we can visit unlimited online shops at one time. The convenience it brings is really a
Breakthrough.

In the past, we can hardly purchase goods from foreign countries or it is not popular to do so.

The Naive Bayes classifiers advantage: high learning and prediction efficiency, easy to realize. When the data is not enough, it also can solve classify problem.
Disadvantage: classifiers result maybe not well, because the assumption of the feature independence may sacrifice the accuracy.How to choose the classifier is depends on many aspects, the training set size, different algorithms advantages,database.its complicated.

There are several type of scheduling, like First-In-First-Out, Last-In-First-Out, Shortest-Path-First, Round-Robin, etc. As discussed, most of the schedulers will imply Round-Robin because it can satisfy most of the tasks and with an acceptable waiting time for each task. However, there are no the best scheduling as it depends on the environment (i.e. task).
When it comes to classifier, they are the same. The advantage of using Naive Bayes is the fact that it is a simple machine learning technique, with a linear training time. Compared to other classifiers training time which is expensive iterative approximation, the cost of running Naive Bayes becomes low. However, as what you mentioned above, it is often criticised for its oversimplified assumption.
I think that Naive Bayes classifier is kind of introduction to machine learning with easy coding. So we may apply Naive Bayes at first. After that, with the growth in knowledge of machine learning and coding, we may apply probabilistic classifier like Bayesian Network, Maximum Entropy. But of course, we need to know about our limitation before choosing a classifier. For an example, if the specification of the system is not strong in enough, running machine learning with iterative training time will be difficult. Then Naive Bayes will be more suitable at this moment.LikeLike",20,64

From the class, I just know that Naive Bayes is an easy way to judge and distribute, but it need us to have special element or circumstance to classify the items or objects. If we cannot consider well we will get the wrong results. Take the example which shown by professor, we identify the apples based on the color is red then the size  and the shape. As our first impression, it is very easy to classify the apples, but think it over, we can find that this system also shows peaches, tomatoes and more other kinds of fruit as apples, so I think this method is too inefficiency. Nevertheless, I get new opinion in your post, I realize that all the efficiency methods are found from some the easy or well-use methods. The reasons why that simple methods are used is that it solves some problems. Maybe the new better ways to classifying is discovering from Naive Bayes. Searching this theory, I found that in 2006, we found some more new methods which have higher performance based on Naive Bayes, for example, Random Forests.
I like the sentence no single solution can solve all problems. Whether the result is good or not, it depends on whether we use a suitable algorithm to solve the particular problem and how we use the technique involved to solve more problems as every method has its strength and limitations. All the tools are waiting for us to develop, that is why we human can be developed from  stone age to nowadays.
From your post and other persons comments, I get some deeper thought about the Naive Bayes. Thank you!LikeLike",20,id not found

Moreover, I find that Stanford University have a project in last year called Metacognizant which aims to develop higher-order thinking skills. It directly asks students to reflect on their learning by through biweekly reflections and the five-minute exercise about they have learned so far in order to develop learning strategies. I think tools like this is useful. It can combat the students prevalent misconception that werent math people. By developing higher-order thinking skills, this tools could discourage the traditional understanding of math: something either can understand immediately or never will. Through deliberately exposing us to higher-order thinking strategies, namely reflection and metacognition, we can begin to close the achievement gap in education.LikeLiked by 1 person",20,9

This quality that human possess makes us distinct from other living creatures. Even though a simple recognition of self also appears in a few animals, human beings show a higher-level self-recognition. Beyond being conscious of oneself as an individual, self-consciousness allows people to be excessively conscious of ones manner. We can inspect the world, including ourselves, from a spectator perspective. As what we have discussed in class, we can perform as agents and subjects at the same time. We observe ourselves in a certain environment and generate a big picture of our existence. This self-consciousness helps us to analyse ourselves and affects our actions by guiding our behaviour.LikeLiked by 1 person",20,id not found

The main arguments used in [2] to support the conclusion that Big data has no role in digital marketing are :
1)	There is no data when the business need it.
2)	Preprocessing data takes too long time.
3)	The big data projects are usually slow.             My idea is that, these arguments are like complaining for the imperfections of status quo. These imperfections will improve over time. And in the long run, big data is still the trend that a prospective business should not miss.
            Why could I say so? Because technology is always moving forward.  It has never stopped for even one second.  As mentioned in your blog, we are generating more and more amount of content (UGC) and they can be perfect source for data.  Indeed collecting them and processing them takes some time, but we are inventing more powerful technology to help us collect all there piece of valuable information.   As for the speed of big data projects, I think the main bottle neck are the parallel algorithms as well as the infrastructure.  With the spread of cloud computing, we can actually enjoy big data service in a much lower cost using the infrastructure on the cloud. For example, Amazon AWS provides ready-to-use suite for big data projects that can help small enterprises analyze their data better.  Moreover, researchers are developing more powerful parallel algorithms and infrastructures that can even speed up the current performance of big data projects.
            In summary, everything is moving forward. Maybe the performance of big data is not at the perfect speed and ROI, it is still the valuable trend that the business should not give up.LikeLike",20,14

Emoji is a kind of language that no one needs to learn before using it. Though some may say that emoji sometimes is not easy to understand. Like Kristawwn has mentioned, boys and girls may interpret the emoji differently. However, I think traditional communication, both texted and spoken communication, also poses the same problem. We should not blame the technology communication but the ways of different people communicate. For example, some people are straightforward and we dont need to guess what he/she actually means while some people like to speak sarcastically.

I think that the meaning of language and body language is based on the common practice of different people. For example, sometimes when we go to foreign countries, we may not know the language of that country, and we would do some body language to express our thoughts. (We may do a posture of putting something in our mouth from a bowl by our hands to express a meaning of eating.) We would understand one another because eating with such a posture is common practice of most of the places around the world. Applying this to the case of emoji, I think that it may be the case that the practice of expressing anger is different between men and women (men may directly express their anger, while women may put a fake smile to pretend that nothing has happened).

However, the file size would not be reduced significantly because of the protection of integrity. In fact, some of the data loss is acceptable. For example, a very high quality picture that the detail could not be distinguished by our sight.

What alibaba did is indeed one way to lower the traffic congestion. Another possible solution for the traffic problems can be building a car sharing information platform so as to reduce the number of private cars in Hangzhou.

Taking future into account, urban planning is so critical that it has profound impacts not only on the structure of city but also on quality of everybodys life.

The smart city system only could solve partial of the traffic congestion. Based on their test, 5%-11% improvement has been achieved on those test roads. Some congestion may be too serious to be solved by only the intelligent arrangement of traffic light. But the improvement is done without any change or rebuild of the road. As we see, rebuilding is a long term job which leads to more serious congestion during the progress and even a not well redesign will contribute less. Solving traffic jam is only the first step of the whole plan. Furthermore, by collecting traffic data, we could simulate the traffic flow in computer which is helpful for the design of future roads. For example, a new road is planned to be built for releasing traffic congestion in area A, the simulation may tell us if the new road is a necessity, what is the start and end point of the road, how many lanes should it be or in what degree the traffic congestion could be reduced.

Indeed the real bottleneck for the big data problems is to parallelize both the infrastructure and the algorithms.

This idea can break a big and memory expensive problem into a parallel problem that can be run separately on commercial machines. Hadoop is a popular ecosystem for solving big data problems. Your description about Hadoop has strengthened my understanding towards it and the related software.
Now that you have showed the algorithm and infrastructure needed to implement a social network recommendation system, maybe you could also provide some ideas for configuring our own Hadoop clusters using Amazon Web Services.

One problem is it needs professional backgrounds to write MR program which limits the use of MR among others such as financial analysts. One solution is called Hadoop Pig. Instead of writing Java or Python, you could write Pig Latin a SQL like language to operate files in HDFS as a SQL table. It takes only 1/60 of original Java code with twice execution time. Pig Latin will be converted into a series of MR jobs automatically. In Yahoo!, 40% of the jobs are in Pig instead of raw MR code. Another Robles is high latency, you may get the result in hours but some data as tweet is generating continuously like water. To get the hot hashtags in the last five minutes, MR is not a good solution. To solve streaming with low latency and high scalability, Apache Storm is created for converting job to a topology instead of map and reduce. ",23,14

Now that you have showed the algorithm and infrastructure needed to implement a social network recommendation system, maybe you could also provide some ideas for configuring our own Hadoop clusters using Amazon Web Services.   Because I know that with our CUHK email we can register an education account to enjoy 100 USD coupons from Amazon.

Another flawless example about the use of information foraging theory is the recommendation system. It is widely used for the public to find things like restaurants, places, that are of their great preference.

The animal wants to gain the most benefit (energy) for the lowest cost during foraging, so that it can maximize its fitness. OFT helps predict the best strategy that an animal can use to achieve this goal.I always believe that IFT definately came from OFT.My focus is on how OFT works.
One of the famous model is optimal in starlings.Starlings leave their nests and travel to food patches in search for larval leatherjackets to bring back to their young. The starlings must determine the optimal number of prey items to take back in one trip (i.e. the optimal load size). While the starlings forage within a patch, they experience diminishing returns: the starling is only able to hold so many leatherjackets in their bill, so the speed with which the parent picks up larvae decreases with the number of larvae that it already has in its bill. Thus, the constraints are the shape of the curve of diminishing returns and the travel time (the time it takes to make a round trip from the nest to a patch and back). In addition, the currency is hypothesized to be net energy gain per unit time.Using this currency and the constraints, the optimal load can be predicted by drawing a line tangent to the curve of diminishing returns, as discussed previously.This process works very similar to the information searching method used in networking(ie.internet)",30,34

The animal wants to gain the most benefit (energy) for the lowest cost during foraging, so that it can maximize its fitness. OFT helps predict the best strategy that an animal can use to achieve this goal.I always believe that IFT definately came from OFT.My focus is on how OFT works.
One of the famous model is optimal in starlings.Starlings leave their nests and travel to food patches in search for larval leatherjackets to bring back to their young. The starlings must determine the optimal number of prey items to take back in one trip (i.e. the optimal load size). While the starlings forage within a patch, they experience diminishing returns: the starling is only able to hold so many leatherjackets in their bill, so the speed with which the parent picks up larvae decreases with the number of larvae that it already has in its bill. Thus, the constraints are the shape of the curve of diminishing returns and the travel time (the time it takes to make a round trip from the nest to a patch and back). In addition, the currency is hypothesized to be net energy gain per unit time.Using this currency and the constraints, the optimal load can be predicted by drawing a line tangent to the curve of diminishing returns, as discussed previously.This process works very similar to the information searching method used in networking(ie.internet)",30,34

In reality, we always change choices due to the social envirnment.

As an engineer, semantic function is something that we are facing and working on every day. They are very important in computer science. We can see that all those three type of program languages are containing many notations, this are some standards for the computer to know what command we are trying to give it. We should appreciate the beauty of it, because it can express a long string of sentence (meaning) in few characters. Just like your figure1, one line of denotational semantics can represent 3 lines of words.

They are ,as I know, making use of user experience (UX) data to construct their searching system. The most popular searched word is saved and arranged at the first stand of the searching list, so that people will probably find the information they are inclined to. Another flawless example about the use of information foraging theory is the recommendation system. It is widely used for the public to find things like restaurants, places, that are of their great preference. Also, people are unnecessary to ask friends or other people to find the places they want to go and, instead, they just need to click on the map or the website on mobile gadget to find it.

http://boscoyam3820.wordpress.com,http://amazinghoran.wordpress.com,2017-03-25,9,"The title is similarity between IFT and OFT,but you have talked alot about information foraging theory on its defination and  application lacking information about optimal foraging theory.If you want to find the similarity ,some analysis on OFT is also needed.Let me share with you some of my understanding about optimal foraging theory.In my opinion,OFT  is a model that helps predict how an animal behaves when searching for food. The animal wants to gain the most benefit (energy) for the lowest cost during foraging, so that it can maximize its fitness. OFT helps predict the best strategy that an animal can use to achieve this goal.I always believe that IFT definately came from OFT.My focus is on how OFT works.
One of the famous model is optimal in starlings.Starlings leave their nests and travel to food patches in search for larval leatherjackets to bring back to their young. The starlings must determine the optimal number of prey items to take back in one trip (i.e. the optimal load size). While the starlings forage within a patch, they experience diminishing returns: the starling is only able to hold so many leatherjackets in their bill, so the speed with which the parent picks up larvae decreases with the number of larvae that it already has in its bill. Thus, the constraints are the shape of the curve of diminishing returns and the travel time (the time it takes to make a round trip from the nest to a patch and back). In addition, the currency is hypothesized to be net energy gain per unit time.Using this currency and the constraints, the optimal load can be predicted by drawing a line tangent to the curve of diminishing returns, as discussed previously.This process works very similar to the information searching method used in networking(ie.internet)",30,34

Sentiment analysis is an important way for manufacturers to determine their products popularity and performance. There are several ways for doing so. As you have mentioned, By analysing the keywords, such as love"", best"", great""and disappointed"", customers emotion towards the product can be measured and turn into facts for further business planning. This is the simplest method for sentiment analysis, Keyword processing. It is done by categorizing words as positive and negative. Then, it determines the overall percentage of positive or negative words in a passage.
Theres also another way called Natural Language Processing (NLP). The principle is to make the computer understand natural language input and generate natural language output. In order words, computers can get the meaning of human words, as it understands that several words form a phrase, several phrases form a sentence, and sentences express ideas.
Though sentiment analysis is really useful for different business and applications, it is not always reliable. Therefore, as an analyst, we should choose a suitable method carefully so that the result can be more comprehensive and reliable.

What I believe is that NLP is talking about people are trying to utilise the machine to understand the massive natural language that is used every day. However, in terms of the compilation that the program is translated into machine code, it is much easier than NLP because we can define the syntax and the meaning of the programming language. If you would like to take a look at my post, I am writing a general comparison between NLP and compilation.

You mentioned that computers translate programming code into machine code(i.e. 0 and 1); similarly, NLP helps human to translate human language into the language that machines can easily understand.
I totally agreed with you. Moreover, I want to add something about the problems of NLP technology. Actually, natural language understanding and natural language generation are 2 main problems in NLP field. For example, its difficult for machine to accurately understand slangs, and generate complex paragraphs in proper grammars and structures.
Hope my addition could give you some inspirations.LikeLike",33,13

However, NLP is much more complicated than programing. In the structure of programing, we comply with programing rules and the computer can convert programing code into machine code precisely and efficiently. As for natural language, the situation is more difficult to handle with. Not like the programing code which are designed particularly for the computer to understand, natural language are mainly used for peoples communication. Thus the natural language have plenty of ambiguilty and irregular usage. Moreover, a word can have totally different meanings under different circumstances. For instance, in sentence he lies down for a rest and he lied about his age, the word lie means occupying a certain position in the first sentence and means telling an untruth in the second sentence. As human, we can understand them depending on our life experience and common sense. However, how can the computer understand as clever as a person Thats a question worthy of research.LikeLike",33,11

Ive never thought about the analogy of  animals hunting for food.  The examples of how wolves/fox hunt for their prey are just enlightening for me. And here I would like to talk about my understanding of three steps of information searching.
  In the first step, you use the expression of information scent, which perfectly articulates how human behave when searching for information like animals hunting in the wild. Take the example of trying to look for a proper course to register in the next semester.  When we know nothing about the course, we will naturally come up with several information paths in our head. Such as going to ask a friend or senior who has taken it, or email the professor about details of the course, or go online and search for the course material from the previous years.  We will then estimate how much information and how valuable/accurate the information could be before taking action, for example, having a talk with the friend/senior about the quality of the course. When you find that you cannot communicate with the friend/senior in a satisfying manner, you might end the conversation and try another path like emailing your professor for more accurate information.  These are exactly what I will do when gathering information about course registration.
 In the second step information diet, I can still use the previous example to illustrate your idea. Although we know that the information provided by seniors/friends may not be up-to-date or complete enough, we still tend to talk to friends/seniors first because they are closer to our lives comparing with professors or course materials in the past.
For the last point, I also think that people will move when they find something better.  Under this fact, we should provide the best user experience as we can when designing our own products to increase the customer lifetime value. Moreover, search engine optimization method could also be utilized to help publicized our product using the internet.

I think entropy is originally generated from the physics area. Then we can also describe the degree of the chaos for information by information entropy. If I understand it in a correct way, the physical world is increasing its entropy no matter what happened, meanwhile, the information must obey the same rule. And we can have a better description of the information that it is keeping enlarging and will be always increasing, which is fascinating and a little bit threatening. Nevertheless, we can better master the essence of the world, isnt it great?",34,22

I also love the example you provide since it makes the concept easy to understand. From the meta-cognition perspective, I really gained some knowledge of how to explain the concepts clearly and reader-friendly.

For example, choose some reliable pages and do not completely believe strangers comments, as these are only opinions but not facts. This kind of communication can allow us to understand an issue with more perspective and also more thoroughly.
Besides, the recommendation feature you have mentioned is also very helpful. You remind me of the recommendation feature in YouTube. In the past, we have to click a new video after we have finished watching one. However, with this feature, YouTube can predict what we may be interested and automatically play it for us.

At the end of the day, we are here to apply technologies to serve peoples need. At the information era, information is everywhere. Making good use of these information can improve our living standard. The key question is how should we apply the information and make it more accessible to human being? This course is made to answer the question. By carrying out sentiment analysis and social network analysis, I believe that we will have a better understanding on how those information is generated and the implication behind it.

We have developed lots of algorithms and infrastructure to mining and processing data to obtain commercial value, but how to display the data to the public is the last yet critical step all the whole chain. Especially in business area, data virtualization seems to be more important. This problem has been caught by some of the top tier companies, for example, Aliyun provides a data visualization service called  to separate data processing with data display. We could change different data visualization board easily as we change the theme of WordPress.LikeLiked by 1 person",44,23
http://stanleylaublog.wordpress.com,http://gravatar.com/richard3320,2017-03-21,9,"Thanks for you sharing! It seems that you did a thorough research of Amazon GO, a newly developed selling form nowadays. You firstly have a brief introduction of Amazon Go, which is clear and easy to follow. Then you show us the difference between contexts of Amazon Go and normal supermarkets. What impressed me most is that you combine the concepts introduced in the previous classes (agents understanding of environment information classification) into the real-life cases, which deepen my perception of theorectical knowledge with practical examples. However, there is one point I cannot fully understand, why the information in Amazon Go is mainly digital? Since in my perspective, for instance, the sensor will detect the physical movement of objects, the camera will recognize the physical features of human face, people will read the price and goods information, these are all physical and semantic information. So my point maybe a bit different from you, I reckon that there is a complex combination of three types of information here, and the higher-layer information makes use of the lower-layer information. Do you agree?LikeLiked by 1 person",44,id not found
http://stanleylaublog.wordpress.com,http://ierg3320jinny.wordpress.com,2017-03-22,9,"Thank you for sharing insight review of amazon go.   I would like to share my personal opinion regarding the advantages and potential limitation of amazon go.
First of all, we can see that utilizing context information in amazon go can create a lot better shopping user experience.   Technologies are invented to help people dissolve their need. However, we have been struggling to learn and manage the complex technologies sometimes, which create the gulf between our goal and the final result.  Contextual computing like amazon go eliminate such gulf by creating a seamless user experience of just walking out with what you want.
Moreover, the amazon go shop can be a perfect test field to collect more real time data regarding customers behavior while shopping.  Besides collecting the final decision (i.e. which customer bought what combination of products), we would be able to collect the route of shopping (from zone A to zone B etc.)  as well as how long the user stop or hesitate in front of a product.  These first-hand data could bring significant potential business value if analyze properly.
However, two of the concerns that must be resolved before the generalization of amazon go are the security problem as well as the computational burden for the system.   The realization of amazon go need the support of internet of things, which is a powerful field but also bringing security disasters as mentioned by several cyber security experts. Contextual computing requires tighter connection, which means that more personal information (the customers face, movement, amazon account etc.) will get exposed in the same environment.  Stronger protection and well-designed security protocol are needed to let all the entities share their information securely.
The last concern is that, all the technology mentioned (computer vision, deep learning etc.) requires relatively high computational power. This may significantly increase the cost of infrastructure for opening a supermarket like amazon go.
Above are my personal thoughts about the advantages and limitation of amazon go.  Discussion is welcomed at any time : )LikeLiked by 1 person",44,14
http://stanleylaublog.wordpress.com,http://fanjunbo.wordpress.com,2017-03-24,9,"Amazon Go is a good attempt for the future retailer model but from where I stand, there are still several problems need to be solved. Firstly is the security issue. As the face detection algorithms are much mature than before, but there is still possible to make a mistake for twins or who did a plastic surgery. Even if in a extreme case, some thieves made a mask of a victim and entered the supermarket face his own face but wore the victim mask to take products after entrance. As Amazon Go needs huge amount of computing resources and it is highly possible that it relies on the Amazon Web Service. If there is crush on AWS may disable the whole Amazon Go system. Second is the fault tolerance. For one single Amazon Go shop, it contains hundreds of sensors and what if a critical sensor is failed. If the shop suffers a sudden error which leads to system crush, how about those customers who are shopping. Should they continue to go shopping, taking what they have bought and leave or put everything back?
With the creation of Beacon technology, some of the business flow in Amazon Go could be much easier to implement than before. For example, customers mobile phone could communicate with sensors for identification instead of face face detection.
From Amazon Go, we could also see the strategy or the future of consuming model. The future consuming model is the mixture of online and offline more intelligent instead of the booming of online while the vanishing of the offline.LikeLiked by 1 person",44,23

However, I think that collecting data from the forums is good but not efficient. By using survey, the researches can collect data about some specific area, but when using online forums, you may be at a loss.

As far as I am concerned, these are two different directions of researching approaches. One is up-down, the other is bottom. (Just like the project we are doing, right?) However, what I concern most is that what is the best way of combining them together? It seems that filling the gap is one of the most crucial part since there is no guarantee that your data will fit in your model. If you create a prior model that contains a bunch of essential aspects of sentiment analysis, the data you collected maybe too narrow and hard to classify. On the other way, if you first perform the data analysis, you may also encounter the non-typical user-generated information and even fail to construct a model. I am wondering whether we can discuss about this problem. By the way, it is also a major course of our project. .LikeLiked by 1 person",44,id not found

For example, by combining the tool and the model, we can not only find the users attitude towards the product and can also know the detail comments on certain objects such as picture, lens and battery. Also in the post, you say that the negative and positive label is not enough. Maybe translate these into certain value will improve the performance.

For example, even in Hong Kong, boys and girls will have different meaning of I am OK for the restaurant or Whatever you want. It was a heat topic in last few months. Therefore, even our human who lives in same place cannot understand the meaning of same words, how can we teach our computers to do this difficult missions? I think so many boys especially the boyfriends hope some day they can get the translation machine of their girl friends. But someone tried to do this machines though the result of cause  From the class about machine learning in our course, we can see that we human have tried so many methods to achieve this goal, and now we can see some little success, for example, supervised learning, linear regression and so on. In my opinion, we are hard to learn the language even machine and human, but we can solve some problems from machine learning. Take my friends FYP as an example, they learnt machine learning and learn the AAC for the communication disabled students and then now they build a wonderful function that communication disabled students can use apps to communicate better. From this result, we can help so many people if we use machine learning well, then we can solve more and more the language or communication problems.LikeLike",48,id not found

Is it possible that the machine will heat us? Can we control them safely? I cannot answer these questions. But according to the knowledge of Machine Learning i have learned before, we, human beings, have some characters that machines may meet difficulty to learn. One is about creativity. The main two methods Supervised Learning, which we have learned in class, and  Unsupervised Learning are both depend on previous data. Learning system maybe the core part of AI. If future AI is still mainly based on learning system depend on previous data. They may still cannot have creativity.

I do agree that although the use of Machine Learning has been boosting these days, there should be a control for the machines and it should not replace human in the future. This is really a great technology transformed computers to be just like human and able to process different information that are useful for human to do different analysis. Machine Learning can help with the data analysis of different online media performance as well as through facial recognition and spoken language understanding.

For example, human are unable to cross the ocean by swimming themselves, so we built ship for long distance travelling in water. And today when we are require to analysis massive of data and executing calculation in no time, we rely on computer.  So machine learning is the same thing, it help us to process uncountable data on internet and analysis users behaviour quickly, which are impossible to achieved by human. Therefore, machine learning is a another great tool created by human. All of the inventions mentioned above are have higher ability in different aspect than human, but it is not meaning human is loser, In fact, they help to improve our life quality instead. I believed that since we are the creator of all the inventions, we have the final control over all of them, so we will always be the beneficiaries with the aid of advance in technology.LikeLike",49,56

However, some people misuse and abuse the use of graphic language. Since people may have different interpretations on the same icon or image, it may cause misunderstanding and decrease in quality of communication. For instance, different people send text message using the same laugh cry emoji, but they may not have the same feeling or meaning to express. From this video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8tvHPpiQs, it is interesting to see that even couples misunderstand the meaning of the emoji from the text.

Furthermore, the smart technology helps the people learn new thing effectively. We can use a pad to search the material that we do not familiar with immediately.

Regarding your argument, I come up two questions. As your source is from Psychology Today. I would also discuss it from psychological perspective. You mentioned that people would hide their emotions in social media very easily. I strongly agree to this. People do not only hide their emotions but also strategically filter poor information about themselves so that they only show the bright side of themselves. But what I wonder is that people would actually do the same thing during face-to-face communication, so why would it be a disadvantage of social media only? Just think of your daily life. Would you expose your true self to everyone? Of course not. So I think it is a common human behavior, but not necessarily attribute to social media.
The second question is about the nonverbal signals, like tone of voices. With nowadays technology, actually we could deliver voice message to friends and relatives. Do you think it is resolution of the problems?",56,49

Although social media brings many advantages like meeting without distance restriction, something still cannot be replaced like emotional interaction. Sometime, a hug or giving a shoulder is better than any words. I love the point that trustful relationship is built under face-to-face interaction rather than communicate through social media.
 If you ask me whether social media can also build trustful relationship, my answer is probably no. I would say social media can be the first step to build relationship, since we can make many new friends through social media.  If you want to build stronger relationship, you need to get along with him or her because you can have better understanding about ones personality through  face-to-face interaction. This is not social media can do.",56,25

http://mosessmng.wordpress.com,http://ierg3320blog.wordpress.com,2017-03-14,8,"Thank you for your sharing. I agreed that it is difficult for the machine to translate the meaning of the words correctly. Take an example of google translation, it is always difficult if we try to use it to translate a paragraph in Chinese to English. It is because it didnt understand the meaning of the whole paragraph, but only translate it word by word. Language is a mysterious thing that we must read the words before and after that word in order to understand it. However, machines are lack of this kind of ability.LikeLiked by 1 personif we think deeply, we can realize the translation function base on a chinese dictionary which made by a group of people, I can sure that they may not know the exact meaning of Xhuan shng ygrn in Cantonese because they speak mandarin instead of Cantonese. In Cantonese, there are 4 different meaning but not in mandarin. Also, the slang used in 80s is different from the slang used nowadays, it keeps changing from time to time. Generally, we can identify which location they are from and what generation they are by slang, but different people with different personalities may use different words to express themselves, so it is not possible to translate his or her speech before having enough communication with him or her. we can only use the machine learning method at this time.LikeLiked by 1 personit is interesting. it is right. In the chinese,  there are many meaing in the same sentance. However, I thing it is not a unsolved  problem. People can know the different meaning by the sound of the word. I think the machine can use the sound to distinguish the different word. LikeLiked by 1 personI like your solid example. It is common to have misunderstanding on sentimental information. As I think that sentimental information is very complicated and can have different interpretation when different people perceive it, computer cannot handle complex sentimental information compared to human. Computer can only handle simple sentimental information like the overall optimist of people on certain event but not the actual emotion of human.LikeLiked by 1 personYour perspective about the sentiment analysis is so interesting and examples you put up is solid.

Expecting for your next step!LikeLiked by 1 personRunning commands in console is sometimes time consuming rather than running in linux. using nohup command in linux to run the python command by executing a shell script, the process or command will not get killed even aborting remote connection.
using bi-gram model and tri-gram model, you can also try to find frequent pairs {i, j} and Frequent Triples {i, j, k} if you interest in. Cheer you up, Moses!LikeLiked by 1 personThanks for your sharing. It is amazing that you have extracted so many data from the twitter and analysed them. However, your mining process only includes the sentence which have the tag #heartstone, most people put up their twitter without the entire name of heartstone, if we want to analyse those twitter relevant to a theme like heartstone, what should we do?LikeLiked by 1 personYes. Some of them put a hashtag #HS, while some of them may not post a tag but the post is related to hearthstone. For the first case, I think what we can do is to find out the Synonyms of #Hearthstone and extract them also. But there is a case that the synonyms we collected may not actually refer to hearthstone. For example, #HS can mean HighSchool.
For the second case, I think we cannot improve it, as it required extraction of all twit and then let the program to determine if the content related to hearthstone and then it will be heavy.
So I think only collect the twit with hashtag #hearthstone is the simple way and it is enough for us to analyse.LikeLiked by 1 personThank you for your work on showing how to perform social media analysis by Python program, the procedures are very clear so that i can follow your steps.

There is similar case like the Flip Flops Designed Competition"" held by New Asia Collage. In that case, my friends from HKU also know it and discuss it with me.
I do agree that if the online media or the famous people who share the news will make the news become viral. But I wonder, these kind of news were only exposed and spread out in a group of people (i.e. University related people). The reason why I have this thought is because when I share the above news to a people who are now working. He responded me that he did not know anything at all.
In order to let every Hong Kong people to know a news, I think the most important thing is the content. For example, Election of Hong Kong Chief Executive, which is very important. Then, both the traditional and the online media will report for it.
Regarding to your words that maybe one day people will not using traditional media, I have some reservations. I think that the traditional media will decline days by days but not be eliminated.

I came across the news that you mentioned in your sharing earlier days as some of my friends commented on it, or shared it. In your case, I can see the rise of social media and why. In fact, I think spreading posts or articles on social media is quite similar as spreading the news through traditional media. Nowadays, we spread information by sharing it with our friends on social media. In the past, we spread information by telling friends directly. It all depends on sharing to our friends. Only that with the assistant of the advanced technology, information can be spread more swiftly and efficiently to a large group of people on social media, which users spend more time on than traditional media as you mentioned.
The rise of social media provides a new way of promotion and arousing public concerns towards certain issues. However, I think it is hard for social media to take over traditional media completely at all in coming years. Perhaps for a certain kind of traditional media, for example, newspapers, it can be transformed into social media.

Indeed, privacy issues is always one of the major concern that oppose the implementation of new technologies. Nowadays, there are more and more CCTV on the streets. This can really restrict people from committing crime. With the use of face recognition, we can easily find out the leaving path of the gangsters using the CCTV. We have to make a balance point about the privacy problem and the efficiency of the new technologies. To deal with this, we should limit the accessibility of such information obtained and make sure that the information is only used for crime issues. With this, I highly believe that the face recognition can be widely used on the coming days .LikeLike",68,65

You point out the problem when the face data leak out, and we may be harmed as our face is a kind of personal information. Besides that, there may be a problem of matching as our face is changing from time to time. The matching will someday be inaccurate and cause trouble to the security system.LikeLike",68,16

As we cant touch or pick the real products up to have a trial on its quality during online shopping, the only way that we can get more information about that products is to see the reviews. Once the reviews goes wrong, people will stop believing the reviews. They wont take the risk trying if the products come with expectation. The online shopping website will then become fail.
Another example is the Taobao in China. Most the products in Taobao usually receive positive rating or even using fake account to pretend the buyers and wrote the fake comments. Thats why people trust Amazon rather then trusting Taobao.LikeLike",68,65

It is important that customer can view the truthful comment about products in an online transaction platform. Because different from a real stop, customer are unable to touch or view the real product online, how they can determine a product is only through the comments from other user. So fake review will cause unsatisfactory of customer who have purchase product from the platform, as they do not get the product they really want. Therefore by banning fake account and ranking of user can help to build up customers confident, and result in more profit of Amazon.LikeLike",68,56

This increases the rate of information flow, and social media acts as a platform for users to share their opinions, ultimately achieving two-way communication.LikeLike",70,15

My previous blog How much can Sentimental Analysis do? just mentioned the accuracy of translation from Chinese to Digital Information. I think that Chinese language is difficult for computer to analyse. As mentioned in my blog post, one Chinese sentences can be explained in four different meaning. But after reading your blog post, I know that the computer will list out all of the probability that the Chinese sentence means. And then after running a scoring function, the computer determine the meaning of the sentences by the scoring function (probability).
But I wonder, in such case, although the computer knows that one Chinese sentences can have different meanings, it will only determine it as one meaning. How about the others meaning which are still possible too? Is that the computer will analyse the whole paragraph in the scoring function?
Moreover, there are sometimes pun, also called paronomasia, is a form of word play that exploits multiple meanings of a term, or of similar-sounding words. But in the case above, computer only explain it in one meaning. I think this is the limitation of the scoring function so far. Will there be a scoring function for pun?

In your experiment, we can find that basing on differnet criterion, we can get differnent result.

Two people have totally different estimations, such as a person hates both two dimensions while the other one likes both them, may get high similarity under the consine similarity criterion. However, the euclidean distance is about your tendency to those dimensions. The lower the distance is, the more similar the two elements are.

Yes, I agree with you that euclidean distance takes less processing time than cosine similarity. However, I could not understand why you said that Respondent 1 is the most similar to respondent 3 because using euclidean distance is much more effective. In my opinion, using less time does not mean that it is better or more accurate. Instead, it depends on what you want to get. According to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19410270/vector-space-model-cosine-similarity-vs-euclidean-distance, Cosine similarity is used to determine the preference / style / sentiment / latent variable of the vector, while the euclidean distance is used to see how strong it is towards that direction.
One example is when you want to classify the category of 10 billions books, you will use Cosine similarity rather than using euclidean distance. But if you want to check how similar is the two document, you will use the euclidean-distance algorithm. e.g plagiarismLikeLike",74,46

For example, most of the modern television have the function to predict what the users would like to watch. Also, most of the social media application, such as Facebook, will collect our preference data in order to provide some specific advertisement to us.

http://fxxxmylife.wordpress.com,http://mosessmng.wordpress.com,2017-03-21,9,"I agree that one of the limitation of contextual computing is difficult to collect personal data. Users are aware of the personal information, and are afraid that their personal data will be used in other purposes than contextual computing, like the news happened in 2010, Octopus sold personal data of customers for interest.
Therefore, in order to collect personal information such as GPS location more easily, the users must agree the applications to collect before launching it. Moreover, to give more confident to the users, I think that the ways of handling such privacy information should be listed in terms and condition. I think that success example like Map Application, users are required to give their locations in order to have navigation options.
I think the most important factor for the users to give personal information in exchange for a context is the attractiveness of the context. Useful functions like navigating to an unknown places for drivers, estimation of bus arriving time, weather forecasting, etc. also require users to give out their personal information like location, previous action. As they are useful functions, users are more likely to give it out.LikeLike",74,64

Generally speaking, I think visual information is more intuitive and easier to grasp. It allows us to work with the concepts symbolically. To name just a few, we use a camera icon rather than the word Camera to represent the photo taking function in iPhone; we use a timer icon instead of the word timer to show the time counting function.Due to the intuitive nature of the visual information, pictures are widely used in social media to share message. The existence of social media actually speeds up the picture spreading process. A 9gag picture can be shared a million times within a day through facebook. Visual information makes the idea exchange easier and faster in social network.",78,73

	In the article, you mentioned that photo will speak the truth, unless someone is editing it, but it sometime merely show a small part of the fact. For me, I see your article as a metaphor. As we may absorb numerous information in any month, week or even just a day, we may observe the change and trend of the world as well. For instance, by hearing of the news of Alpha Go and looking at the film culture of artificial intelligence, we may observe that computer is somehow smarter than us, some may believe that human will be replaced soon. But for me, this piece of information doesnt represent the full picture, since what stored in Alpha Go are only target-based machine learning algorithms, there are still no human-like learning algorithms implemented. And that is the reason why we have this course, we are actually approaching the front-most place in the machine learning area, no matter how bad is the organization of the lecture notes, and how hard to understand the concept in it.
	I think we must observe deeper and think more, dont rely on the news, as news often report the fact after you miss the chance to get involved. We should have the right recognition of the development of technology, without recognizing the right potential and risk, we may not have the true image of the full picture. How is it benefiting our society? How attractive is it to the market? Is there any risk to the law and ethics? We should have the right answer in our mind.",78,id not found

the top 10 machine learning algorithm are:
1.Linear regression
2.Logistic regression
3.k-means
4.SVMs
5.Random Forests
6.Matrix Factorization/SVD
7.Gradient Boosted Decision Trees/Machines
8.Naive Bayes
9.Artificial Neural Networks
10. Bayesian NetworksMost of them are supervised learning algorithm, including Linear regression, Logistic regression, SVMs, Random Forests, Decision Tree, Navie Bayes etc.The unsupervised learning with the highest ranking is K-means algorithm.
Here is the interesting demonstration of K-means algorithm:
http://shabal.in/visuals/kmeans/5.htmlYou could see that K-mean algorithm first randomly pick up K central points (green in color). Then assign all other points to their nearest K points and update the central points. Keep looping this process until the result converges or unchanged.Although it is simple, it is sometimes good enough in some situations. (e.g points are separated very long to each other)",79,46

For example, the song of Air Supply All Out of Love was covered by Hong Kong singer Mr Tam and become another well-known song . Music is amazing.

We can also say he has made great contribution to the human information interruption.
After the computer technology develop rapidly, I think this has made the music industry stronger. As we can see nowadays, personal live telecast is very popular in network platform, we can usually see some people use Facebook live to sing in front of thousands of people.
